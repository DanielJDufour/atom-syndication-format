The pyramids, too, are\nastonishing structures, each one them equal to many of the most ambitious\nworks of Greece; but the labyrinth surpasses them.  It has twelve covered\ncourts - six in a row facing north, six south - the gates of the one range\nexactly fronting the gates of the other.  Inside, the building is of two\nstoreys and contains three thousand rooms, of which half are underground, and\nthe other half directly above them.  I was taken through the rooms in the\nupper storey, so what I shall say of them is from my own observation, but the\nunderground ones I can speak of only from report, because the Egyptians in\ncharge refused to let me see them, as they contain the tombs of the kings who\nbuilt the labyrinth, and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles.  The upper\nrooms, on the contrary, I did actually see, and it is hard to believe that\nthey are the work of men; the baffling and intricate passages from room to\nroom and from court to court were and endless wonder to me, as we passed from\na courtyard into rooms, from rooms into galleries, from galleries into more\nrooms and thence into yet more courtyards.  The roof of every chamber,\ncourtyard, and gallery is, like the walls, of stone.  The walls are are\ncovered with carved figures, and each court is exquisitely built of white\nmarble and surrounded by a colonnade. Near the corner where the labyrinth\nends there is a pyramid, two hundred and forty feet in height, with great\ncarved figures of animals on it and an underground passage by which it can be\nentered.  Marvellous as the labyrinth is the so-called Lake of Moeris beside\nwhich it stands is perhaps even more astonishing ... this immense basin is\nobviously artificial, for nearly in the middle of it are two pyramids,\nstanding three hundred feet out of the water (with their bases an equal depth\nbelow the surface) and each surmounted by the stone image of a man sitting on\na throne.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’m saddened that I’ll never get to visit. \nHis descriptions of things that still stand, for example the Pyramids, is\nvivid too; they were a lot prettier 2,400 years ago.</p>\n<h2>The War</h2>\n<p>I am not a historian and have been telling myself for years that I really\nought to get a good competent modern scholarly history of this war and see\nwhat I learn - I did study it in college but that’s a long time ago, so\nmy take is heavily influenced by Herodotus’.</p>\n<p>The Persian empire was a fairly recent arrival at this time; it grew\nastonishingly fast, and the Persians were the superpower of their time as\nAmerica is of ours.\nThus, their failure to overrun Greece is surprising.\nThe numbers that Herodotus bandies about - in excess of 2½; million in\nXerxes’ invasion force - are hard to believe, but pretty clearly it was a big\narmy.</p>\n<p>The conventional wisdom is that the Greeks - in particular the Athenians -\nhad dramatically superior maritime/naval skills, and that in close combat the\nmore heavily armed and amored Greek phalanx could handle substantially larger\nnumbers of the more lightly-armed Persians.\nThe Greek generalship seems to have been good at the battle of Marathon and\nthe less-known but crucial battle of Plataea, but doesn’t seem to have been\nthat much of a factor elsewhere.\nIt’s also worth noting that a substantial proportion of the Greek city-states\nhad (some voluntarily) signed up with the Persians, so there were Greeks on\nboth sides in these battles.</p>\n<p>Herodotus’ take seems pretty fair - while he is pro-Greek, he quick to\npraise particularly brave, wise, or honourable Persians.\nLikewise, he is ruthless in his description of the backbiting, bribery, and\ntreachery that dominated the relationships between the Greek cities; so much\nso as to increase one’s wonder that they managed to win this war.\nOne is left far from impressed with some of the famous Greek personages whom\nyou may remember from your history books.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Greeks are consistent in pointing out that they are\nfighting for freedom and (a then-new idea) democracy, and against a foreign\ninvader; these are all advantages.</p>\n<p>Herodotus had a hometown-boy penchant for talking up the achievements of\nthe Halicarnassians; this is pleasant in that we get the spotlight on one\nArtimesia, their queen, fighting for the Persians at Salamis, the only\nfemale commander (says Herodotus) there,\nand by his account a dashing figure.\nPursued by a larger Greek ship, she adopted the strategy of ramming and\nsinking the nearest Persian ship; the Greek decided she must be a friend and\nabandoned the pursuit, while Xerxes, sitting on the hillside watching the\nbattle, exclaimed “Today my men turn to women and my women to\nmen!”;</p>\n<p>And, Herodotus remarks conversationally, “She was lucky in every way -\nnot least in the fact that there were no survivors from the Calyndian ship \n[that she rammed] to\naccuse her.”;  Hmm.</p>\n<p>Of course the most famous of all these battles was at Thermopylae, where\nLeonidas and his 300 Spartans held up the entire Persian army for days by\ndefending a narrow defile and being perfectly willing to die rather than be\nmoved.</p>\n<p>After the war the Greeks erected a monument, now gone, with an inscription\nthat de Sélincourt translates:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Go tell the Spartans, you who read<br/>\nWe took their orders, and are dead.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But there are other translations; I like</p>\n<blockquote><p>Go stranger, and to Sparta tell:<br/>\nHere, faithful to its law, we fell.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Parallels With Current Events?</h2>\n<p>It is tempting to draw a parallel between the events of BCE 479 and those\nof 2003; after all, here we have the world’s pre-eminent power engaging in\ntwo wars against a much smaller one, the first led by a father and the second\nby a son, at an interval of about ten years.</p>\n<p>But I don’t think there’s any mileage there;\nnobody thinks the Iraqis have superior military technology, and nobody is\nexpecting the equivalent of a Thermopylae.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Herodotus’ account of the treacherous butchery by which\nDarius came to occupy the throne of Persia and pass it on to his son Xerxes is\nquite reminiscent of Republican party politics.</p>\n<p>And there’s a lesson to be learned from Leonidas: when you have a smart\nand determined enemy who’s willing to die to hurt you, you’re usually going\nto get hurt.  For a contemporary example consider 9/11.</p>\n<h2>Gene Wolfe Takes up Herodotus’ Torch</h2>\n<p>Gene Wolfe, for my money the greatest living writer of sci-fi, fantasy,\nand lots of other stuff too, published two books in the Eighties,\n<cite>Soldier of the Mist</cite> and <cite>Soldier of Arete</cite>, the first\ndedicated to Herodotus and both set in the period immediately following the\nfailure of Xerxes’ invasion.\nThey feature many of the personages who appear in Herodotus’ narrative, and\nare gripping, deep, and magical.\nFurthermore Wolfe, unlike me, is a serious student both of military history\nand of archaic theology, and you’ll learn a whole bunch about the realities\nof life and war in the Classical period.</p>\n<h2>Web Resources</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/\">Perseus project</a> has an\n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.1.0\">astounding \nonline edition</a> of the <cite>Histories</cite>, with heavily\nannotated and hyperlinked texts available in English and Greek.</p>\n</div></content></entry>",

The pyramids, too, are\nastonishing structures, each one them equal to many of the most ambitious\nworks of Greece; but the labyrinth surpasses them.  It has twelve covered\ncourts - six in a row facing north, six south - the gates of the one range\nexactly fronting the gates of the other.  Inside, the building is of two\nstoreys and contains three thousand rooms, of which half are underground, and\nthe other half directly above them.  I was taken through the rooms in the\nupper storey, so what I shall say of them is from my own observation, but the\nunderground ones I can speak of only from report, because the Egyptians in\ncharge refused to let me see them, as they contain the tombs of the kings who\nbuilt the labyrinth, and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles.  The upper\nrooms, on the contrary, I did actually see, and it is hard to believe that\nthey are the work of men; the baffling and intricate passages from room to\nroom and from court to court were and endless wonder to me, as we passed from\na courtyard into rooms, from rooms into galleries, from galleries into more\nrooms and thence into yet more courtyards.  The roof of every chamber,\ncourtyard, and gallery is, like the walls, of stone.  The walls are are\ncovered with carved figures, and each court is exquisitely built of white\nmarble and surrounded by a colonnade. Near the corner where the labyrinth\nends there is a pyramid, two hundred and forty feet in height, with great\ncarved figures of animals on it and an underground passage by which it can be\nentered.  Marvellous as the labyrinth is the so-called Lake of Moeris beside\nwhich it stands is perhaps even more astonishing ... this immense basin is\nobviously artificial, for nearly in the middle of it are two pyramids,\nstanding three hundred feet out of the water (with their bases an equal depth\nbelow the surface) and each surmounted by the stone image of a man sitting on\na throne.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’m saddened that I’ll never get to visit. \nHis descriptions of things that still stand, for example the Pyramids, is\nvivid too; they were a lot prettier 2,400 years ago.</p>\n<h2>The War</h2>\n<p>I am not a historian and have been telling myself for years that I really\nought to get a good competent modern scholarly history of this war and see\nwhat I learn - I did study it in college but that’s a long time ago, so\nmy take is heavily influenced by Herodotus’.</p>\n<p>The Persian empire was a fairly recent arrival at this time; it grew\nastonishingly fast, and the Persians were the superpower of their time as\nAmerica is of ours.\nThus, their failure to overrun Greece is surprising.\nThe numbers that Herodotus bandies about - in excess of 2½; million in\nXerxes’ invasion force - are hard to believe, but pretty clearly it was a big\narmy.</p>\n<p>The conventional wisdom is that the Greeks - in particular the Athenians -\nhad dramatically superior maritime/naval skills, and that in close combat the\nmore heavily armed and amored Greek phalanx could handle substantially larger\nnumbers of the more lightly-armed Persians.\nThe Greek generalship seems to have been good at the battle of Marathon and\nthe less-known but crucial battle of Plataea, but doesn’t seem to have been\nthat much of a factor elsewhere.\nIt’s also worth noting that a substantial proportion of the Greek city-states\nhad (some voluntarily) signed up with the Persians, so there were Greeks on\nboth sides in these battles.</p>\n<p>Herodotus’ take seems pretty fair - while he is pro-Greek, he quick to\npraise particularly brave, wise, or honourable Persians.\nLikewise, he is ruthless in his description of the backbiting, bribery, and\ntreachery that dominated the relationships between the Greek cities; so much\nso as to increase one’s wonder that they managed to win this war.\nOne is left far from impressed with some of the famous Greek personages whom\nyou may remember from your history books.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Greeks are consistent in pointing out that they are\nfighting for freedom and (a then-new idea) democracy, and against a foreign\ninvader; these are all advantages.</p>\n<p>Herodotus had a hometown-boy penchant for talking up the achievements of\nthe Halicarnassians; this is pleasant in that we get the spotlight on one\nArtimesia, their queen, fighting for the Persians at Salamis, the only\nfemale commander (says Herodotus) there,\nand by his account a dashing figure.\nPursued by a larger Greek ship, she adopted the strategy of ramming and\nsinking the nearest Persian ship; the Greek decided she must be a friend and\nabandoned the pursuit, while Xerxes, sitting on the hillside watching the\nbattle, exclaimed “Today my men turn to women and my women to\nmen!”;</p>\n<p>And, Herodotus remarks conversationally, “She was lucky in every way -\nnot least in the fact that there were no survivors from the Calyndian ship \n[that she rammed] to\naccuse her.”;  Hmm.</p>\n<p>Of course the most famous of all these battles was at Thermopylae, where\nLeonidas and his 300 Spartans held up the entire Persian army for days by\ndefending a narrow defile and being perfectly willing to die rather than be\nmoved.</p>\n<p>After the war the Greeks erected a monument, now gone, with an inscription\nthat de Sélincourt translates:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Go tell the Spartans, you who read<br/>\nWe took their orders, and are dead.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But there are other translations; I like</p>\n<blockquote><p>Go stranger, and to Sparta tell:<br/>\nHere, faithful to its law, we fell.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Parallels With Current Events?</h2>\n<p>It is tempting to draw a parallel between the events of BCE 479 and those\nof 2003; after all, here we have the world’s pre-eminent power engaging in\ntwo wars against a much smaller one, the first led by a father and the second\nby a son, at an interval of about ten years.</p>\n<p>But I don’t think there’s any mileage there;\nnobody thinks the Iraqis have superior military technology, and nobody is\nexpecting the equivalent of a Thermopylae.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Herodotus’ account of the treacherous butchery by which\nDarius came to occupy the throne of Persia and pass it on to his son Xerxes is\nquite reminiscent of Republican party politics.</p>\n<p>And there’s a lesson to be learned from Leonidas: when you have a smart\nand determined enemy who’s willing to die to hurt you, you’re usually going\nto get hurt.  For a contemporary example consider 9/11.</p>\n<h2>Gene Wolfe Takes up Herodotus’ Torch</h2>\n<p>Gene Wolfe, for my money the greatest living writer of sci-fi, fantasy,\nand lots of other stuff too, published two books in the Eighties,\n<cite>Soldier of the Mist</cite> and <cite>Soldier of Arete</cite>, the first\ndedicated to Herodotus and both set in the period immediately following the\nfailure of Xerxes’ invasion.\nThey feature many of the personages who appear in Herodotus’ narrative, and\nare gripping, deep, and magical.\nFurthermore Wolfe, unlike me, is a serious student both of military history\nand of archaic theology, and you’ll learn a whole bunch about the realities\nof life and war in the Classical period.</p>\n<h2>Web Resources</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/\">Perseus project</a> has an\n<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.1.0\">astounding \nonline edition</a> of the <cite>Histories</cite>, with heavily\nannotated and hyperlinked texts available in English and Greek.</p>\n</div>",

I dunno, but when you follow the\n    footnote pointers, the bot’s offerings are consistent with what you find there.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, the perception created is that the bot is doing a fairly vanilla Web search to turn up sources, then\n    writing a neutrally-toned précis of what it found.\n    I can hardly express how much difference those footnotes made to me. (After I checked them, of course.) I was suddenly prepared\n    to think about this thing as a mostly-safe maybe-useful tool.</p>\n    <p>I did the same deep-dives on Lawrence and Demerara, and the bot managed to avoid huge this-is-just-all-wrong errors. It\n    wasn’t perfect, there was one little problem with event sequencing.

The mountains rise like giants in the distance, Their peaks shrouded in mist, a sight of purest\n    brilliance. The city itself is a place of contrasts, A mix of old and new, of history and progress. From the Space Needle to\n    Pike Place Market, There’s always something new to discover and savor. Seattle is a city of dreams, A place where anything is\n    possible, or so it seems.”</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Samuel R. Delany</b>: “Seattle is a city of many faces, a place where the future and the past collide. It’s a city of\n    contrasts, where the gleaming towers of downtown stand in stark contrast to the rugged beauty of the surrounding mountains. The\n    streets are alive with the sounds of people from all walks of life, from the techies of Amazon and Microsoft to the artists and\n    musicians who call the city home. The air is thick with the scent of coffee and the sound of rain, a symphony of sensory\n    delights that is uniquely Seattle. From the Space Needle to the waterfront, there’s always something new to discover in this\n    city of dreams.”</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Shakespeare</b>: “In fair Seattle, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood\n    makes civil hands unclean. From forth the teeming streets of this fair town, A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;\n    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents’ strife. The fearful passage of their death-marked\n    love, And the continuance of their parents’ rage, Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours’\n    traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>\n    <p>…of <b>e.e. cummings</b>: “in just Seattle, this city of rain where the streets are alive with the sound of feet and the air\n    is thick with the scent of coffee and the sound of music fills the night here is the city of dreams where anything is possible\n    and the mountains rise like giants in the distance and the Space Needle stands tall against the sky in just Seattle, where the\n    future and the past collide and the beauty of the world is all around here is a place where the heart can soar and the soul can\n    find its home.</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Sylvia Plath</b>: “In Seattle, the rain falls like tears from the sky, A never-ending stream of sorrow and pain. The\n    streets are dark and empty, The buildings looming like shadows in the night. The mountains rise like sentinels in the distance,\n    Their peaks shrouded in mist and mystery. The city is a place of secrets and shadows, A place where the heart can break and the\n    soul can die. But even in the darkness, there is beauty to be found, A glimmer of hope in the depths of despair. For in Seattle,\n    as in life, There is always a chance for redemption and renewal.</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Bing chat</b>: “Seattle is a city of many faces, a place where the future and the past collide.

But first…</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Do you have an opinion?</h2>\n    <p>Please don’t post it.</p>\n    <p>First, go and read\n    <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922\">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too\n    Big?</a> (lead authors Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru.)\n    I’m serious; it’s only ten pages (not including references) and if you haven’t read it, you’re simply not qualified to publish\n    anything on this subject.</p>\n    <p>Here are the highlights, which I’m only listing so I can discuss them; the following is <em>not</em> a substitute for reading\n    Bender and Gebru.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>The carbon load of LLM model-building and execution is horrifying. Quote: “…the amount of\n      compute used to train the largest deep learning models (for NLP and other applications) has increased 300,000x in 6 years,\n      increasing at a far higher pace than Moore’s Law.”</p>\n      <p>(Also, some of the economics involve shitty behavior; QA’ing LLMs is lousy, time-consuming work, so why not underpay poor\n      people in the Third World?)</p></li>\n      <li><p>The data sets that current LLMs are trained on are basically any old shit off the Internet, which means they’re full of\n      intersectionally-abusive language and thinking. Quote: “Feeding AI systems on the world’s beauty, ugliness, and cruelty, but\n      expecting it to reflect only the beauty is a fantasy.”</p></li>\n      <li><p>The whole LLM frenzy is diverting attention from research on machine language <em>understanding</em> as opposed to\n      statistically-driven <em>prediction</em>. Quote: “If a large LM, endowed with hundreds of billions of parameters and trained\n      on a very large dataset, can manipulate linguistic form well enough to cheat its way through tests meant to require language\n      understanding, have we learned anything of value about how to build machine language understanding or have we been led down the\n      garden path?” Also: “However, no actual language understanding is taking place in LM-driven approaches to these tasks, as can\n      be shown by careful manipulation of the test data to remove spurious cues the systems are leveraging.\n      [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108\">21</a>, \n      <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07355\">93</a>]”</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>My experience with the LLM bots really had me nodding along to #1. When you throw a prompt at one of these things, what\n    happens ain’t fast; it takes seconds and seconds to get the answer back. My background in cloud computing and concurrency\n    research gives me, I think, a pretty good gut feel for this sort of stuff and, well… it’s <em>really freaking\n    expensive</em>!  I think that if it were cheap, that might change my (increasingly negative) view of the cost/benefit\n    ratio.</p>\n    <p>Initially, I was less worried about #2. The Internet is already full of intersectionally-abusive crap (not to\n    mention outright lies), and we do make progress at fighting it and creating safe spaces, albeit agonizingly slow.\n    It’s not obvious to me that shitty LLMs are a worse problem than shitty people.</p>\n    <p>The good news is that there’s a clear path to addressing this, which Bender &amp; Gebru lay out: Curate your\n    damn training data! And be transparent and accountable about what it is and how it’s used.\n    Unfortunately, OpenAI doesn’t do transparency.</p>\n    <p>Then the bad news: On the Internet, the truth is paywalled and the bullshit is free. And as just discussed, one of the\n    problems with LLMs is that they’re expensive. Another is that they’re being built by capitalists. Given the choice between\n    expensive quality ingredients and free bullshit, guess which they’ll pick?</p>\n    <p>On #3, I don’t have enough technical depth for well-founded opinion, but my intuition-based feelings are\n    mixed. Yeah, the LLM-transform statistical methods are sort of a kludge, but you know what, so is human intelligence.  Nobody\n    would ever hire me to do AGI research but if they did, I’d start with a multipronged assault on language, using whatever\n    witches’ brew of statistical and other ML methods were at hand.</p>\n    <p>Remember, John Searle’s “Chinese Room” argument is just wrong; at some point, if you build something that convinces \n    educated, skeptical, observers that they’re talking to a real intelligence, the only safe hypothesis is that it’s a real\n    intelligence.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Other voices</h2>\n    <p>Noam Chomsky and a couple of colleagues write, in the\n    <cite>NYTimes</cite>:\n    <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html\">The False Promise of ChatGPT</a>. Obviously,\n    it would be dumb to ignore input from Chomsky, but I found this kind of shallow. I don’t think it’s axiomatic that a\n    hypothetical AGI need be built around the same trade-offs that our own intelligence is.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, here’s Sabine Hossenfelder (in a video, transcript only on Patreon):\n    <a href=\"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2023/03/i-believe-chatbots-partly-understand.html\">I believe chatbots partly\n    understand what they chat about. Let me explain.</a> Quote: “Understanding can’t be inferred from the relationship between input\n    and output alone.” I’m not sure Dr H entirely convinced me, but that video is both intellectually dense and funny, and I\n    strongly recommend it; her conclusions are studded with what seem to me extremely wise observations.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>What do I think?</h2>\n    <p>3,500 words in and… um, I dunno. Really. I am somewhat consoled by the fact that nobody else does, either.</p>\n    <p>There are a very few posts I’m willing to drive into the ground:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>The claim that LLMs are nothing more than\n      <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@zkat@toot.cat/110034419651017125\">fancy expensive markov chains</a> is a dangerous\n      oversimplification or, in other words, wrong.</p></li>\n      <li><p>There are going to be quality applications for this stuff. For example, reading out picture descriptions to blind\n      people.</p></li>\n      <li><p>In the same way that the Bing bot seems to be useful at looking up stuff online, it’s useful for computer programmers,\n      to automate searching Stack Overflow. I asked it for suggestions on how to dedupe Go structs with slice fields, since you\n      can’t use those as map keys, and it turned up pointers to useful discussions that I’d missed.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Are these things remotely cost-effective? I mean, it’s cool that Bing could research the relationship\n      between <cite>DS9</cite> and <cite>B5</cite>, and that it threw in humanizing detail about the softball games, but the\n      number of watt-hours it probably burnt to get there is shocking. For what values of “worth it” is it worth it?</p></li>\n      <li><p>Relatedly, it’s blindingly obvious that the VC and Big-Tech leadership are way out over their skis on this one, and that\n      billions and billions are going to be pissed away on fever dreams pitched by people who were talking up crypto DAOs until last\n      month.</p></li> \n    </ul>\n    <p>Just now I wouldn’t bet my career on this stuff, nor would I ignore it.</p>\n    <p>It’s really, really OK to say “I don’t know.”</p>\n</div></content></entry>",

It bothers me <em>a lot</em> when it\n    gives no warnings, cites no sources, and provides no confidence interval.</p>\n    <p>I’m unconvinced that this smoothed-out voice from nowhere deserves our attention.</p>\n    <p>Now, Bing…</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/14/sci-fi.png\" alt=\"Big chat on DS9 and B5\" />\n    <p>Before you even begin to think about what’s in the bot’s two paragraphs, please cast your eyes just below them,\n    where, in tastefully decorated shades of blue, there are… <em>Footnotes!</em></p>\n    <p>When you send a prompt to the bot, while it’s calculating it flashes up little messages saying “searching X … searching Y…”\n    and so on, where the X and Y are what show up in the footnotes.  Umm… is it really doing that?  I dunno, but when you follow the\n    footnote pointers, the bot’s offerings are consistent with what you find there.</p>\n    <p>Anyhow, the perception created is that the bot is doing a fairly vanilla Web search to turn up sources, then\n    writing a neutrally-toned précis of what it found.\n    I can hardly express how much difference those footnotes made to me. (After I checked them, of course.) I was suddenly prepared\n    to think about this thing as a mostly-safe maybe-useful tool.</p>\n    <p>I did the same deep-dives on Lawrence and Demerara, and the bot managed to avoid huge this-is-just-all-wrong errors. It\n    wasn’t perfect, there was one little problem with event sequencing. But way better than GPT-3; admittedly, a low bar.</p>\n    <p>At one point, on the Lawrence thread, it was reciting words, nearly verbatim, that I’d personally added to Wikipedia. I’m not sure\n    that’s wrong, the text meets Wikipedia’s pretty-decent citation standards.</p>\n    <p>I’m not going to paste in the huge gobs of dialog that other writers have, but here’s a bit of entertainment: I asked the bot\n    to write a description \n    of Seattle “in the style of” a few different voices that seem distinctive to me.</p>\n    <p>In the style of <b>Ezra Pound</b>: “In the city of Seattle, the rain falls like a symphony of tears, A melody that echoes through\n    the streets and fills the ears. The mountains rise like giants in the distance, Their peaks shrouded in mist, a sight of purest\n    brilliance. The city itself is a place of contrasts, A mix of old and new, of history and progress. From the Space Needle to\n    Pike Place Market, There’s always something new to discover and savor. Seattle is a city of dreams, A place where anything is\n    possible, or so it seems.”</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Samuel R. Delany</b>: “Seattle is a city of many faces, a place where the future and the past collide. It’s a city of\n    contrasts, where the gleaming towers of downtown stand in stark contrast to the rugged beauty of the surrounding mountains. The\n    streets are alive with the sounds of people from all walks of life, from the techies of Amazon and Microsoft to the artists and\n    musicians who call the city home. The air is thick with the scent of coffee and the sound of rain, a symphony of sensory\n    delights that is uniquely Seattle. From the Space Needle to the waterfront, there’s always something new to discover in this\n    city of dreams.”</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Shakespeare</b>: “In fair Seattle, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood\n    makes civil hands unclean. From forth the teeming streets of this fair town, A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;\n    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents’ strife. The fearful passage of their death-marked\n    love, And the continuance of their parents’ rage, Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours’\n    traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>\n    <p>…of <b>e.e. cummings</b>: “in just Seattle, this city of rain where the streets are alive with the sound of feet and the air\n    is thick with the scent of coffee and the sound of music fills the night here is the city of dreams where anything is possible\n    and the mountains rise like giants in the distance and the Space Needle stands tall against the sky in just Seattle, where the\n    future and the past collide and the beauty of the world is all around here is a place where the heart can soar and the soul can\n    find its home.</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Sylvia Plath</b>: “In Seattle, the rain falls like tears from the sky, A never-ending stream of sorrow and pain. The\n    streets are dark and empty, The buildings looming like shadows in the night. The mountains rise like sentinels in the distance,\n    Their peaks shrouded in mist and mystery. The city is a place of secrets and shadows, A place where the heart can break and the\n    soul can die. But even in the darkness, there is beauty to be found, A glimmer of hope in the depths of despair. For in Seattle,\n    as in life, There is always a chance for redemption and renewal.</p>\n    <p>…of <b>Bing chat</b>: “Seattle is a city of many faces, a place where the future and the past collide.

But first…</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Do you have an opinion?</h2>\n    <p>Please don’t post it.</p>\n    <p>First, go and read\n    <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922\">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too\n    Big?</a> (lead authors Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru.)\n    I’m serious; it’s only ten pages (not including references) and if you haven’t read it, you’re simply not qualified to publish\n    anything on this subject.</p>\n    <p>Here are the highlights, which I’m only listing so I can discuss them; the following is <em>not</em> a substitute for reading\n    Bender and Gebru.</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>The carbon load of LLM model-building and execution is horrifying. Quote: “…the amount of\n      compute used to train the largest deep learning models (for NLP and other applications) has increased 300,000x in 6 years,\n      increasing at a far higher pace than Moore’s Law.”</p>\n      <p>(Also, some of the economics involve shitty behavior; QA’ing LLMs is lousy, time-consuming work, so why not underpay poor\n      people in the Third World?)</p></li>\n      <li><p>The data sets that current LLMs are trained on are basically any old shit off the Internet, which means they’re full of\n      intersectionally-abusive language and thinking. Quote: “Feeding AI systems on the world’s beauty, ugliness, and cruelty, but\n      expecting it to reflect only the beauty is a fantasy.”</p></li>\n      <li><p>The whole LLM frenzy is diverting attention from research on machine language <em>understanding</em> as opposed to\n      statistically-driven <em>prediction</em>. Quote: “If a large LM, endowed with hundreds of billions of parameters and trained\n      on a very large dataset, can manipulate linguistic form well enough to cheat its way through tests meant to require language\n      understanding, have we learned anything of value about how to build machine language understanding or have we been led down the\n      garden path?” Also: “However, no actual language understanding is taking place in LM-driven approaches to these tasks, as can\n      be shown by careful manipulation of the test data to remove spurious cues the systems are leveraging.\n      [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04108\">21</a>, \n      <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07355\">93</a>]”</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>My experience with the LLM bots really had me nodding along to #1. When you throw a prompt at one of these things, what\n    happens ain’t fast; it takes seconds and seconds to get the answer back. My background in cloud computing and concurrency\n    research gives me, I think, a pretty good gut feel for this sort of stuff and, well… it’s <em>really freaking\n    expensive</em>!  I think that if it were cheap, that might change my (increasingly negative) view of the cost/benefit\n    ratio.</p>\n    <p>Initially, I was less worried about #2. The Internet is already full of intersectionally-abusive crap (not to\n    mention outright lies), and we do make progress at fighting it and creating safe spaces, albeit agonizingly slow.\n    It’s not obvious to me that shitty LLMs are a worse problem than shitty people.</p>\n    <p>The good news is that there’s a clear path to addressing this, which Bender &amp; Gebru lay out: Curate your\n    damn training data! And be transparent and accountable about what it is and how it’s used.\n    Unfortunately, OpenAI doesn’t do transparency.</p>\n    <p>Then the bad news: On the Internet, the truth is paywalled and the bullshit is free. And as just discussed, one of the\n    problems with LLMs is that they’re expensive. Another is that they’re being built by capitalists. Given the choice between\n    expensive quality ingredients and free bullshit, guess which they’ll pick?</p>\n    <p>On #3, I don’t have enough technical depth for well-founded opinion, but my intuition-based feelings are\n    mixed. Yeah, the LLM-transform statistical methods are sort of a kludge, but you know what, so is human intelligence.  Nobody\n    would ever hire me to do AGI research but if they did, I’d start with a multipronged assault on language, using whatever\n    witches’ brew of statistical and other ML methods were at hand.</p>\n    <p>Remember, John Searle’s “Chinese Room” argument is just wrong; at some point, if you build something that convinces \n    educated, skeptical, observers that they’re talking to a real intelligence, the only safe hypothesis is that it’s a real\n    intelligence.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Other voices</h2>\n    <p>Noam Chomsky and a couple of colleagues write, in the\n    <cite>NYTimes</cite>:\n    <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html\">The False Promise of ChatGPT</a>. Obviously,\n    it would be dumb to ignore input from Chomsky, but I found this kind of shallow. I don’t think it’s axiomatic that a\n    hypothetical AGI need be built around the same trade-offs that our own intelligence is.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, here’s Sabine Hossenfelder (in a video, transcript only on Patreon):\n    <a href=\"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2023/03/i-believe-chatbots-partly-understand.html\">I believe chatbots partly\n    understand what they chat about. Let me explain.</a> Quote: “Understanding can’t be inferred from the relationship between input\n    and output alone.” I’m not sure Dr H entirely convinced me, but that video is both intellectually dense and funny, and I\n    strongly recommend it; her conclusions are studded with what seem to me extremely wise observations.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>What do I think?</h2>\n    <p>3,500 words in and… um, I dunno. Really. I am somewhat consoled by the fact that nobody else does, either.</p>\n    <p>There are a very few posts I’m willing to drive into the ground:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>The claim that LLMs are nothing more than\n      <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@zkat@toot.cat/110034419651017125\">fancy expensive markov chains</a> is a dangerous\n      oversimplification or, in other words, wrong.</p></li>\n      <li><p>There are going to be quality applications for this stuff. For example, reading out picture descriptions to blind\n      people.</p></li>\n      <li><p>In the same way that the Bing bot seems to be useful at looking up stuff online, it’s useful for computer programmers,\n      to automate searching Stack Overflow. I asked it for suggestions on how to dedupe Go structs with slice fields, since you\n      can’t use those as map keys, and it turned up pointers to useful discussions that I’d missed.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Are these things remotely cost-effective? I mean, it’s cool that Bing could research the relationship\n      between <cite>DS9</cite> and <cite>B5</cite>, and that it threw in humanizing detail about the softball games, but the\n      number of watt-hours it probably burnt to get there is shocking. For what values of “worth it” is it worth it?</p></li>\n      <li><p>Relatedly, it’s blindingly obvious that the VC and Big-Tech leadership are way out over their skis on this one, and that\n      billions and billions are going to be pissed away on fever dreams pitched by people who were talking up crypto DAOs until last\n      month.</p></li> \n    </ul>\n    <p>Just now I wouldn’t bet my career on this stuff, nor would I ignore it.</p>\n    <p>It’s really, really OK to say “I don’t know.”</p>\n</div>",

I know what a solution might look like, and if\n    someone can build it and charge just a little bit for access, they might become very wealthy.</p>\n    <img src=\"apple-tv.png\" alt=\"Apple TV+\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p>Alternatively, if someone could build an\n    open-protocol-based co-operative tool to fix the problem, they’d be a benefactor of humanity.</p>\n    <p>Let’s call the thing I want a “Stream Automator”, Automator for short. I thought of “Streamplex” but there are\n    already a few things named that; none of them look likely to be significant in the long-term but oh well.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/03/crave.png\" alt=\"Crave TV\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Let’s make it personal</h2>\n    <p>My family still has dumb-cable TV. It’s absurdly expensive and all anyone watches on it are live sports. We\n    subscribe to a couple of streaming services, which give us access to maybe 20% of the really happening shows that people are\n    talking about.</p>\n    <p>So, I want to dump dumb-cable and still watch the sports I like and the TV that matters.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/03/dazn.png\" alt=\"DAZN\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p>Axiom: Subscribing to everything is not a sane option. <em>There has to be a better way.</em></p>\n    <p><b>Complication</b>: Sports coverage.\n    In Canada where we are, there are two national sports streamers that offer disjoint packages. Then there are global services like\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN\">DAZN</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/03/disney.png\" alt=\"Disney+\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p>It’s unreasonably difficult to discover exactly which games you can watch\n    on which channels. For example, in recent seasons I’ve enjoyed watching the Toronto Blue Jays. For years I’d been an MLB.tv\n    subscriber, but I dropped it because the Jays are blocked since they’re my “local” team (three timezones away), which is OK\n    I guess because I can get them on one of those sports networks that happens to be included with our current dumb-cable package,\n    but maybe not because we pay for some extra sports, and the dumb-cable company makes it really hard to figure out what exactly you’re\n    subscribing for.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/03/espn.png\" alt=\"ESPN\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p><b>Complication</b>: VPN. A member of my family (also in Canada) is an NFL fan and boasts that he watches any game he wants\n    without paying a penny, via VPN magic.<br/><i>[Is that legal? -Ed.]</i> <i>[I’ve no idea; that’s the point. -T.]</i></p>\n    <p><b>Complication</b>: National borders. Here in Canada, if you want to watch HBO you subscribe to something called “Crave\n    TV”, which gets you most of (all of?) the HBO stuff and some Paramount. Except for, you might do better going upstream with a\n    VPN. But some of the streamers are smart about blocking them.</p>\n    <img src=\"hbo.png\" alt=\"HBO max\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p>The point isn’t “Canada is hard”; it’s that every country is going to have its own streaming-provider weirdness.</p>\n    <p><b>Complication</b>: Your hardware. We have Roku but no AppleTV hardware. It doesn’t seem like that matters, I can\n    ChromeCast Apple TV+, is that weird?</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/03/mlb.png\" alt=\"MLB.tv\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p>Also, one of the many irritants about our dumb-cable service is that it’s 720p with no upgrade path.\n    We have a nice LG 4K screen but I’ve watched ballgames where the picture looked like my grandparents’ big console Color TV\n    in the Sixties.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of that LG TV, it runs on\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS\">WebOS</a>, with loads of stream-provider apps, except for it’s really\n    hard to turn any of that on without becoming a part of LG’s data-farming operation. Ewww.</p>\n    <img src=\"netflix.png\" alt=\"Netflix\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p>Also, I haven’t figured out how to\n    route the TV audio outfit back into the A/V receiver; this involves something called “eARC” which the TV and the receiver\n    both claim to support but does not Just Work.</p>\n    <p><i>[Update: Writing this got me mad enough to take another run at it, figured it out. Seems like an OK Roku competitor.]</i></p>\n    <p>Oh, and our neighbor has a digital TV antenna up on his roof and he gets a whole bunch of mainstream channels free off the\n    air with an absolutely fabulous picture, including marquee events like the Olympics and so on. Hmmm.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/03/03/paramount.png\" alt=\"Paramount+\" class=\"inline\"/>\n    <p><b>Complication</b>: Streaming networks offer you lower prices if you sign up for a whole year. But if I want to watch\n    <cite>Ted Lasso</cite> and <cite>Succession</cite> and <cite>Russian Doll</cite> and <cite>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</cite>\n    and <cite>The Rings of Power</cite>\n    over the next year, it becomes rational to switch subscriptions every month or two. At what cost? I dunno, I want someone to\n    tell me.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>The problem</h2>\n    <p>It’s really freaking complicated and time-consuming and error-prone to discover what’s available from what providers at what\n    cost.

If you care about this subject at all, do me a favor and go\n    read it. I’ll wait.  Then, a few more words about doing this in 2023 and into the future.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Stats &amp; tech</h2>\n    <p>As I write this, there are 5,263 entries here containing 5,098 pictures and 2,249,991 words. \n    At which point, the following picture applies, stolen from Rakhim’s\n    <a href=\"https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/\">Honestly Undefined</a>, “A webcomic about computers and uncertainty”:</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/Rakhim-graph.png\" alt=\"Cartoon by Rakhim: Blogging vs blog setups\" />\n    <p>Heh… I’m the “Weird dude who writes raw HTML” (in Emacs, no less) but then I’m also an “Author of custom static site\n    generators”.</p>\n    <p>But, unlike most such\n    authors, I never write about the generator (nor will I ever open-source it) because it’s kind of gross: 3,000 lines of Perl\n    written in a brief 2002 hyperfocus episode. It’s all in one file, with no concessions to modularity nor modernity.  OK, if you\n    must, here’s <a href=\"/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/18/Baking-ongoing\">More on Baking</a>, about something that I think this site does\n    right.</p>\n    <p>You know what does make me feel a little smug? My writing environment. Yeah, I author in what’s more or less XHTML, but I\n    basically never type an angle-bracket. Emacs is simply the world’s best tool for high-powered text editing and on this hill I\n    will die. For the members of the Emacs tribe, a couple of snippets that may cause smiles and nods.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/ongoing-mode.png\" alt=\"Emacs voodoo to help publish this blog\"/>\n    <p>So when you press <code>'</code>, below are the things you can follow it with.\n    This works because nobody with good taste would ever use a dumb\n    naked non-typographical single quote, so I repurpose it as a blogging-command-initiator.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/ong-insert-special.png\" alt=\"Emacs voodoo to help publish this blog\"/>\n    <h2 id='p-20'>Sidebar: How many words?</h2>\n    <p>Above, I mentioned the number of words so far. It was actually kind of\n    hard to measure since a lot of the text is XML junk. So I got Lauren to write me a two-line XSLT and then I had a pure-text version of\n    all the entries.  Unfortunately, <code>wc -w</code> and Emacs disagreed on the word count, by a lot. So I opened up the 14-Mb\n    <code>.txt</code> file in Microsoft Word; say what you will, that program does know how to count ’em.  Mind you, it burned 14\n    minutes of CPU time to figure out that the text (in the default 10.5pt Courier New monospace) would occupy 7,028 pages.</p>\n    <p>(Of course, that word count doesn’t include the contents of this section.)</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>POSSE</h2>\n    <p>That’s the word for what this blog is, as defined\n    <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">over at indieweb.org</a>: “POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site,\n    Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third\n    parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your\n    content.”</p>\n    <p>Cory Doctorow recently published\n    <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/\">Pluralistic is three</a>, from which: “POSSE stands for ‘Post Own\n    Site, Share Everywhere’, and it's an idea that comes out of the Indieweb movement. Under POSSE, you post your work to a site you\n    control, but syndicate to all the platforms and silos, with a link back to the original.”</p>\n    <p>Which seems like self-evidently a good approach. It allows me to not care very much that the quips and links I post to Twitter or\n    Mastodon or whatever the social flavor-of-the-month is might go away. If I really care about it, it gets published here.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Impact?</h2>\n    <p>As in, I put a lot of work into this space and it’s reasonable to ask: Has it mattered, and if so, to whom?</p>\n    <p>The biggest impact is obvious, that would be the impact on my life. The blog has got me jobs, helped me hire, found me\n    friends, taught me \n    to write better, taught me about running a production application, and been a ticket to join conversations I care about. Without it, my\n    life would be immensely poorer along multiple dimensions. I have not regretted launching this thing for even a second over all\n    the years.</p>\n    <p>How about impact on other people? Well, I don’t track readership, very much. I couldn’t if I wanted to, because I publish a\n    full-text RSS/Atom feed, and it’s being fetched all the time by loads of different aggregators and other random software. Some\n    of the feed fetchers say (in the User-agent) how many subscribers they’re fetching on behalf of. Last time I added those up it\n    came to twenty thousand or so, but on the one hand, lots of those people will have stopped following feeds a decade ago,\n    and on the other, some of them come from Slack or Teams, and some from IP addresses inside governments and big companies. So,\n    who knows? I sure don’t.</p>\n    <p>I do have a script that plows through recent website logs and pretty reliably counts actual human reads through a browser\n    (from the site, not the feed). I don’t run it that often, but let’s go do that right now:</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/stats.png\" alt=\"Recent ongoing viewership statistics\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>Human reads of <span class='o'>ongoing</span> articles for the last two weeks.\n    Some of these, from years previous, retain a pleasing residual readership.</p></div>\n    <p>I guess one thing is worth saying: These numbers are up quite a bit since I started posting links on Mastodon.</p>\n    <p>Also, year after year,\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/23/UPI\">/2005/12/23/UPI</a> keeps getting fetched for no reason I can discern, except\n    perhaps that it includes the phrase “cat semantics”.</p>\n    <p>In this space, I’ve had the privilege of arguing against the horrors of <code>WS-*</code>, against Single Page Applications\n    (especially about the time when Twitter became one, for a while), and against cryptocurrencies. Not always contra: I’ve inveighed\n    in favor of REST, of Android as a viable platform, of\n    Unicode (and especially UTF-8), of Ruby, of Go, and of functional-programming idioms.</p>\n    <p>Most of those arguments came out the way I wanted, and while I would never claim to have moved any\n    needles myself, my rhetoric probably didn’t hurt. And then there’s the important thing<span class='dashes'> —</span> the privilege of being part of the\n    conversation.</p>\n    <p>These days I’m advocating against what Twitter has become and in favor of the Fediverse. Let’s see how this one turns out.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>Thinking tool</h2>\n    <p>When I’m thinking about something complicated and not sure what to make of it, it’s really super-helpful to start writing an\n    <span class='o'>ongoing</span> piece about it. Sometimes I find a path to a coherent argument that I believe in; and then\n    sometimes I discover that I didn’t actually think what I thought I thought; still a useful outcome. I recommend this practice.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Greatest hits</h2>\n    <p>I still have plenty of writing energy but am getting kind of\n    old<span class='dashes'> —</span> <span class='o'>ongoing’s</span> past is doubtless bigger than its future.</p>\n    <p>I’ve always thought that when a musician starts doing re-releases and “Greatest Hits” packages, it’s a signal they’ve lost\n    their mojo, and not much new goodness is to be expected.  But over the past twenty years there’ve been pieces that I\n    suspect might find a second readership if dropped into social media and the feed.  So I’m going to try the occasional “Twenty\n    Years Ago Today” and see if I find it rewarding.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>Thanks!</h2>\n    <p>For reading, now and for all those years.  I hope you’ve benefited by just a tiny fraction of the amount that I have.</p>\n    <p>Near the top of this piece I recommended you go read that\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/201x/2013/02/27/Blog-birthday\">tenth-anniversary piece</a>, but I bet lots of you didn’t, so let me\n    reproduce its closing flourish:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Hahaha, this is a podium so I get to preach sometimes:</p>\n      <ul>\n\t<li><p>Write about things while you’re learning them; by the time you’re an\n\texpert it’s too late to start.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Write long phrases then shorten them.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Long sentences are OK though.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Sweat the typography.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Use fewer commas.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Use semicolons.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Be intense.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Be brief.</p></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>And most important of all, ignore everything social-media hacks\n      say about building your audience. It’s not that they’re wrong, but as\n      soon as your goal is “building your audience” it’s over.  You’re corrupted and\n      you’ve lost.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Thanks again!</p>\n</div></content></entry>",

If you care about this subject at all, do me a favor and go\n    read it. I’ll wait.  Then, a few more words about doing this in 2023 and into the future.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Stats &amp; tech</h2>\n    <p>As I write this, there are 5,263 entries here containing 5,098 pictures and 2,249,991 words. \n    At which point, the following picture applies, stolen from Rakhim’s\n    <a href=\"https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/\">Honestly Undefined</a>, “A webcomic about computers and uncertainty”:</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/Rakhim-graph.png\" alt=\"Cartoon by Rakhim: Blogging vs blog setups\" />\n    <p>Heh… I’m the “Weird dude who writes raw HTML” (in Emacs, no less) but then I’m also an “Author of custom static site\n    generators”.</p>\n    <p>But, unlike most such\n    authors, I never write about the generator (nor will I ever open-source it) because it’s kind of gross: 3,000 lines of Perl\n    written in a brief 2002 hyperfocus episode. It’s all in one file, with no concessions to modularity nor modernity.  OK, if you\n    must, here’s <a href=\"/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/18/Baking-ongoing\">More on Baking</a>, about something that I think this site does\n    right.</p>\n    <p>You know what does make me feel a little smug? My writing environment. Yeah, I author in what’s more or less XHTML, but I\n    basically never type an angle-bracket. Emacs is simply the world’s best tool for high-powered text editing and on this hill I\n    will die. For the members of the Emacs tribe, a couple of snippets that may cause smiles and nods.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/ongoing-mode.png\" alt=\"Emacs voodoo to help publish this blog\"/>\n    <p>So when you press <code>'</code>, below are the things you can follow it with.\n    This works because nobody with good taste would ever use a dumb\n    naked non-typographical single quote, so I repurpose it as a blogging-command-initiator.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/ong-insert-special.png\" alt=\"Emacs voodoo to help publish this blog\"/>\n    <h2 id='p-20'>Sidebar: How many words?</h2>\n    <p>Above, I mentioned the number of words so far. It was actually kind of\n    hard to measure since a lot of the text is XML junk. So I got Lauren to write me a two-line XSLT and then I had a pure-text version of\n    all the entries.  Unfortunately, <code>wc -w</code> and Emacs disagreed on the word count, by a lot. So I opened up the 14-Mb\n    <code>.txt</code> file in Microsoft Word; say what you will, that program does know how to count ’em.  Mind you, it burned 14\n    minutes of CPU time to figure out that the text (in the default 10.5pt Courier New monospace) would occupy 7,028 pages.</p>\n    <p>(Of course, that word count doesn’t include the contents of this section.)</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>POSSE</h2>\n    <p>That’s the word for what this blog is, as defined\n    <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">over at indieweb.org</a>: “POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site,\n    Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third\n    parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your\n    content.”</p>\n    <p>Cory Doctorow recently published\n    <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/\">Pluralistic is three</a>, from which: “POSSE stands for ‘Post Own\n    Site, Share Everywhere’, and it's an idea that comes out of the Indieweb movement. Under POSSE, you post your work to a site you\n    control, but syndicate to all the platforms and silos, with a link back to the original.”</p>\n    <p>Which seems like self-evidently a good approach. It allows me to not care very much that the quips and links I post to Twitter or\n    Mastodon or whatever the social flavor-of-the-month is might go away. If I really care about it, it gets published here.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Impact?</h2>\n    <p>As in, I put a lot of work into this space and it’s reasonable to ask: Has it mattered, and if so, to whom?</p>\n    <p>The biggest impact is obvious, that would be the impact on my life. The blog has got me jobs, helped me hire, found me\n    friends, taught me \n    to write better, taught me about running a production application, and been a ticket to join conversations I care about. Without it, my\n    life would be immensely poorer along multiple dimensions. I have not regretted launching this thing for even a second over all\n    the years.</p>\n    <p>How about impact on other people? Well, I don’t track readership, very much. I couldn’t if I wanted to, because I publish a\n    full-text RSS/Atom feed, and it’s being fetched all the time by loads of different aggregators and other random software. Some\n    of the feed fetchers say (in the User-agent) how many subscribers they’re fetching on behalf of. Last time I added those up it\n    came to twenty thousand or so, but on the one hand, lots of those people will have stopped following feeds a decade ago,\n    and on the other, some of them come from Slack or Teams, and some from IP addresses inside governments and big companies. So,\n    who knows? I sure don’t.</p>\n    <p>I do have a script that plows through recent website logs and pretty reliably counts actual human reads through a browser\n    (from the site, not the feed). I don’t run it that often, but let’s go do that right now:</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/27/stats.png\" alt=\"Recent ongoing viewership statistics\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>Human reads of <span class='o'>ongoing</span> articles for the last two weeks.\n    Some of these, from years previous, retain a pleasing residual readership.</p></div>\n    <p>I guess one thing is worth saying: These numbers are up quite a bit since I started posting links on Mastodon.</p>\n    <p>Also, year after year,\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/23/UPI\">/2005/12/23/UPI</a> keeps getting fetched for no reason I can discern, except\n    perhaps that it includes the phrase “cat semantics”.</p>\n    <p>In this space, I’ve had the privilege of arguing against the horrors of <code>WS-*</code>, against Single Page Applications\n    (especially about the time when Twitter became one, for a while), and against cryptocurrencies. Not always contra: I’ve inveighed\n    in favor of REST, of Android as a viable platform, of\n    Unicode (and especially UTF-8), of Ruby, of Go, and of functional-programming idioms.</p>\n    <p>Most of those arguments came out the way I wanted, and while I would never claim to have moved any\n    needles myself, my rhetoric probably didn’t hurt. And then there’s the important thing<span class='dashes'> —</span> the privilege of being part of the\n    conversation.</p>\n    <p>These days I’m advocating against what Twitter has become and in favor of the Fediverse. Let’s see how this one turns out.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>Thinking tool</h2>\n    <p>When I’m thinking about something complicated and not sure what to make of it, it’s really super-helpful to start writing an\n    <span class='o'>ongoing</span> piece about it. Sometimes I find a path to a coherent argument that I believe in; and then\n    sometimes I discover that I didn’t actually think what I thought I thought; still a useful outcome. I recommend this practice.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Greatest hits</h2>\n    <p>I still have plenty of writing energy but am getting kind of\n    old<span class='dashes'> —</span> <span class='o'>ongoing’s</span> past is doubtless bigger than its future.</p>\n    <p>I’ve always thought that when a musician starts doing re-releases and “Greatest Hits” packages, it’s a signal they’ve lost\n    their mojo, and not much new goodness is to be expected.  But over the past twenty years there’ve been pieces that I\n    suspect might find a second readership if dropped into social media and the feed.  So I’m going to try the occasional “Twenty\n    Years Ago Today” and see if I find it rewarding.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>Thanks!</h2>\n    <p>For reading, now and for all those years.  I hope you’ve benefited by just a tiny fraction of the amount that I have.</p>\n    <p>Near the top of this piece I recommended you go read that\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/201x/2013/02/27/Blog-birthday\">tenth-anniversary piece</a>, but I bet lots of you didn’t, so let me\n    reproduce its closing flourish:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Hahaha, this is a podium so I get to preach sometimes:</p>\n      <ul>\n\t<li><p>Write about things while you’re learning them; by the time you’re an\n\texpert it’s too late to start.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Write long phrases then shorten them.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Long sentences are OK though.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Sweat the typography.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Use fewer commas.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Use semicolons.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Be intense.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Be brief.</p></li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>And most important of all, ignore everything social-media hacks\n      say about building your audience. It’s not that they’re wrong, but as\n      soon as your goal is “building your audience” it’s over.  You’re corrupted and\n      you’ve lost.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Thanks again!</p>\n</div>",

But it doesn’t vanish, and its over-excited\n    attempt at smart quotes is offensive. Does not advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Berkeley Mono (not free)</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"berkeley.png\" alt=\"Berkeley Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“Berkeley Mono wears a UNIX T-shirt and aspires to be etched on control panels in black synthetic\n    lacquer.

It operates with calibrated precision and has a\n    datasheet.”</p></div>\n    <p>Really a lot of people who reacted to Part 1 of this were passionate about Berkeley, “Best money I ever spent”, etc.</p>\n    <p>I can see why, a lot of the letterforms are easy on the eye, and it’s pleasantly solid.</p>\n    <p>I won’t use it though, because the kerning hurts my eyes. “Wait!”, you say. “Monospace fonts don’t have kerning!” OK then,\n    it’s just that the letters are too far apart and the spaces between them are non-uniform in a jarring way.</p>\n    <p>Also, the baseline of the type feels jagged, which doesn’t help my eyes flow along.

I’m in team anti-ligature but no biggie.</p>\n    <p>I can see why they said “fun”, it’s friendly and unassuming. But not for me, the letterforms are just too chunky-square,\n    and it has the awful single smart quotes like Anonymous. Even if I used this in my IDE I wouldn’t in my shell, simply because of\n    the broken underline, too small and squashed up against the bottoms of the letters.

Some of the letterforms are objectively ridiculous (“D”,\n    “e”). And, as Wikipedia says, quoting the BBC, “The typeface’s widespread use, often in situations it was not intended for, has\n    been the subject of criticism and ridicule.” Clearly, the scenarios I’m considering here are <em>not</em> what Comic Sans was\n    intended for.</p>\n    <p>But, to my eye, it’s readable and friendly and unassuming. The characters have a smooth horizontal flow.\n    Granted, its line-height is slightly too small, so your text looks a bit\n    squashed, but that’s really my only technical objection.

I spent years of my life more or less living in Courier (often Courier New\n    Bold) on the screens of Unix\n    workstations and X Terminals (If you don’t know what an X Terminal is, that’s OK. It’s not you, it’s me.)</p>\n    <p>There’s really nothing terribly wrong with this one. I could live with it. But our understanding of how to present electronic\n    text has grown sufficiently during my lifetime that I don’t think Courier Prime deserves to advance in 2023.</p>\n    <p>But, maybe for screenplays?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>Dank Mono (not free)</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"dank.png\" alt=\"Dank Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“A typeface designed for coding aesthetes with modern displays in mind. Delightful ligatures and<br/>an\n    italic variant and bold style.”</p></div>\n    <p>It’s OK, I guess. There’s only one thing wrong, but it’s fatally, unforgivably wrong: That lower-case “f”, which looks like a newt\n    that got squashed on the pavement.\n    If you can live with\n    that glyph, this font might make you happy because it’s nicely light, perfectly legible, and has good flow.

It doesn’t excite me or make me happy but it absolutely doesn’t get in\n    the way. Nice flow, nice balance, nice line height. It’s got “Sans” in its name and serifs are rigorously eschewed (except for the\n    almost-unavoidable lower-case “l”), which I think adds integrity to the design.  Advances.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>Fantasque Sans Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"fantasque.png\" alt=\"Fantasque Sans Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like\n    fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.”</p></div>\n    <p>I detect a little influence from our friend Comic Mono, above? And I have to say that “wibbly-wobbly, etc” is not what I\n    <em>think</em> I’m looking for in a working font.</p>\n    <p>But I don’t hate this. It’s balanced, clear, and readable. Its lower-case “g” with the bottom loop works, which most\n    monospace attempts don’t. The tail on the lower-case “y” is kinda cute.  Like Cascadia, in a shell window the underline styling\n    is borked, but that’s a minor sin.</p>\n    <p>This is definitely not going to be for everyone, but there’s really nothing wrong with it. Advances.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-9'>Liberation Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"liberation.png\" alt=\"Liberation Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>The Liberation family was commissioned by Red Hat from Steve Matheson.

They’re really not like anything else. “L” and “l” are unnervingly similar. The “a” should be wrong in\n    theory but sort of works.</p>\n    <p>The whole font sort of works! Um… I like it?

Tl;dr: I looked at a bunch of monospace fonts and recommended a\n    few. The piece went kind of nuts, way past 50K views as I write this, and a flood of comments here and on YCombinator,\n    nearly all of which took the form of “You left out my favorite font, which is X!” So I harvested 14 values of X, and let’s have\n    a look at them! I’ve enjoyed this little project enough to pay actual real money for three of these.</p>\n    <p>The methodology is the same as last outing.  For each font, I post a shot of a the Linux ls(1) man page, switch Emacs\n    into that font, and use it to write my feelings about it.  Those fonts I consider excellent advance to round two, where I\n    assemble screenshots of them displaying code in the Goland IDE.</p>\n    <p>In this episode: Anonymous Pro, Berkeley Mono, Cascadia Mono, Comic Mono, Courier Prime, Dank Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono,\n    Fantasque Sans Mono, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monofur, MonoLisa, Recursive Mono Linear, and Victor Mono.\n    Reactions of the form “But you didn’t look at X” will almost certainly fall on deaf ears.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Anonymous Pro</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"anonymous.png\" alt=\"Anonymous Pro\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“Anonymous Pro is based on an earlier font, Anonymous™ (2001), my TrueType version of Anonymous 9, a\n    Macintosh bitmap font developed in the mid-’90s<br/>by Susan Lesch and David Lamkins.”</p></div>\n    <p>It’s pretty anonymous, all right; as in exhibiting no distinctive features. But it doesn’t vanish, and its over-excited\n    attempt at smart quotes is offensive. Does not advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Berkeley Mono (not free)</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"berkeley.png\" alt=\"Berkeley Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“Berkeley Mono wears a UNIX T-shirt and aspires to be etched on control panels in black synthetic\n    lacquer. It is Adrian Frutiger visits Bell Labs. It is Gene Kranz's command. It operates with calibrated precision and has a\n    datasheet.”</p></div>\n    <p>Really a lot of people who reacted to Part 1 of this were passionate about Berkeley, “Best money I ever spent”, etc.</p>\n    <p>I can see why, a lot of the letterforms are easy on the eye, and it’s pleasantly solid.</p>\n    <p>I won’t use it though, because the kerning hurts my eyes. “Wait!”, you say. “Monospace fonts don’t have kerning!” OK then,\n    it’s just that the letters are too far apart and the spaces between them are non-uniform in a jarring way.</p>\n    <p>Also, the baseline of the type feels jagged, which doesn’t help my eyes flow along. Does not advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Cascadia Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"cascadia.png\" alt=\"Cascadia Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“Cascadia is a fun new coding font that comes bundled with Windows Terminal, and is now the default font\n    in Visual Studio as well.”</p></div>\n    <p>It comes in Code and Mono, one of which has those coding ligatures. I’m in team anti-ligature but no biggie.</p>\n    <p>I can see why they said “fun”, it’s friendly and unassuming. But not for me, the letterforms are just too chunky-square,\n    and it has the awful single smart quotes like Anonymous. Even if I used this in my IDE I wouldn’t in my shell, simply because of\n    the broken underline, too small and squashed up against the bottoms of the letters. Doesn’t advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Comic Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://dtinth.github.io/comic-mono-font/\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"comic.png\" alt=\"Comic Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“A legible monospace font… the very typeface you’ve been trained to recognize since childhood. This font\n    is a fork of Shannon Miwa’s Comic Shanns (version 1).”</p></div>\n    <p>Here’s where I get myself in trouble, because… I kind of like it. Some of the letterforms are objectively ridiculous (“D”,\n    “e”). And, as Wikipedia says, quoting the BBC, “The typeface’s widespread use, often in situations it was not intended for, has\n    been the subject of criticism and ridicule.” Clearly, the scenarios I’m considering here are <em>not</em> what Comic Sans was\n    intended for.</p>\n    <p>But, to my eye, it’s readable and friendly and unassuming. The characters have a smooth horizontal flow.\n    Granted, its line-height is slightly too small, so your text looks a bit\n    squashed, but that’s really my only technical objection. And, Dear Readers, these little letters\n    carry, among those of our tribe, consequential cultural weight.</p>\n    <p>It advances. Don’t shoot me. Plenty of my code is Comical. Are you against happiness?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Courier Prime</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"courier-prime.png\" alt=\"Courier Prime\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“It’s Courier, just better…<br/>…Designed for Screenplays<br/>…Looks sharp everywhere.”</p></div>\n    <p>Disclosure: The Courier font was created in the year I was born, originally for the IBM Selectric, which was a fabulous piece of\n    technology (for its day) and don’t you forget it. I spent years of my life more or less living in Courier (often Courier New\n    Bold) on the screens of Unix\n    workstations and X Terminals (If you don’t know what an X Terminal is, that’s OK. It’s not you, it’s me.)</p>\n    <p>There’s really nothing terribly wrong with this one. I could live with it. But our understanding of how to present electronic\n    text has grown sufficiently during my lifetime that I don’t think Courier Prime deserves to advance in 2023.</p>\n    <p>But, maybe for screenplays?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>Dank Mono (not free)</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"dank.png\" alt=\"Dank Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“A typeface designed for coding aesthetes with modern displays in mind. Delightful ligatures and<br/>an\n    italic variant and bold style.”</p></div>\n    <p>It’s OK, I guess. There’s only one thing wrong, but it’s fatally, unforgivably wrong: That lower-case “f”, which looks like a newt\n    that got squashed on the pavement.\n    If you can live with\n    that glyph, this font might make you happy because it’s nicely light, perfectly legible, and has good flow. But not for\n    me. Doesn’t advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>DejaVu Sans</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://dejavu-fonts.github.io\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"dejavu.png\" alt=\"DejaVu Sans Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“…a font family based on the Vera Fonts. Its purpose is to provide a wider range of characters while\n    maintaining the original look and feel…”<br/>(Vera was a family from Bitstream released in 2001.)</p></div>\n    <p>I can’t find anything negative to say about this one. It doesn’t excite me or make me happy but it absolutely doesn’t get in\n    the way. Nice flow, nice balance, nice line height. It’s got “Sans” in its name and serifs are rigorously eschewed (except for the\n    almost-unavoidable lower-case “l”), which I think adds integrity to the design.  Advances.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>Fantasque Sans Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"fantasque.png\" alt=\"Fantasque Sans Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like\n    fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.”</p></div>\n    <p>I detect a little influence from our friend Comic Mono, above? And I have to say that “wibbly-wobbly, etc” is not what I\n    <em>think</em> I’m looking for in a working font.</p>\n    <p>But I don’t hate this. It’s balanced, clear, and readable. Its lower-case “g” with the bottom loop works, which most\n    monospace attempts don’t. The tail on the lower-case “y” is kinda cute.  Like Cascadia, in a shell window the underline styling\n    is borked, but that’s a minor sin.</p>\n    <p>This is definitely not going to be for everyone, but there’s really nothing wrong with it. Advances.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-9'>Liberation Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"liberation.png\" alt=\"Liberation Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>The Liberation family was commissioned by Red Hat from Steve Matheson. These have identical metrics to\n    the default Microsoft Office fonts such as Arial and Times New Roman, and are the defaults in Libre Office.</p></div>\n    <p>It’s perfectly OK, really no complaints, but unfortunately the next font in this list does everything it does just a little\n    better. So, doesn’t advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-10'>Menlo</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"menlo.png\" alt=\"Menlo\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“a monospaced sans-serif typeface designed by Jim Lyles. The face first shipped with Mac OS X Snow\n    Leopard. Menlo is based upon the open source font Bitstream Vera and the public domain font DejaVu.”</p></div>\n    <p>If it’s good enough to anchor the monospaced text in MacOS, it’s probably good enough for anyone.  Certainly\n    for me. The fact that I’m a long-time Mac user is probably influencing me here, but I can’t imagine this one really\n    bothering anyone. Vanishes. Advances.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-11'>monofur</h2>\n    <p>Start… uh, where? Doesn’t seem to have a home page.</p>\n    <img src=\"monofur.png\" alt=\"monofur\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“…a basic, fixed-width font<br/>designed by Tobias Benjamin Kohler”</p></div>\n    <p>I’m not really sure what to say. The letterforms suggest Hobbit aesthetics, or maybe some other rural neighborhood in your favorite\n    swords-and-sorcery books. They’re really not like anything else. “L” and “l” are unnervingly similar. The “a” should be wrong in\n    theory but sort of works.</p>\n    <p>The whole font sort of works! Um… I like it? I don’t know if I’d seriously suggest it as a daily driver, but I’m going to\n    advance it anyhow because I really want to see if it’s as charming in the IDE as it is here in my Emacs window.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-12'>MonoLisa (not free)</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://www.monolisa.dev\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"monolisa.png\" alt=\"MonoLisa\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“MonoLisa was designed by professionals to improve developers’ productivity and reduce fatigue.”</p></div>\n    <p>I have a problem with this, as I do with Dank: One bad letter.

It cheers me up that traditional rootsy guitar-boogie\n    still has a substantial audience. The notion that a Rock act might lead the streaming charts, or play the Super Bowl halftime, or\n    generally matter to the cultural mainstream, feels quaint in 2023. (But let’s not forget Måneskin’s Eurovision 2021\n    victory.)</p>\n    <p>It also\n    pleased me that the crowd was generously supplied both with fresh-faced kids and grizzled greybeards.  And that the\n    performers were thirty years younger than me; I count on being able to listen to new Rock music into my grave.</p>\n    <p>And on this music being played hard and loud, with any luck, long after I’m forgotten.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Drama</h2>\n    <p>As the band was swinging into the first song, Rebecca was looking into the front row of the crowd and said something like\n    “You OK, dude?” Then she called the band to a halt and yelled “Security! There’s this guy roughing up women down here in front; get him\n    out!” and sure enough two burly security guys extracted him (with considerable difficulty) and dragged him away.</p>\n    <p>It’s hard to\n    stop a rock band with forward momentum; I remember the famous Altamont video, Mick Jagger yelling “Keith, stop, Keith, KEITH!”\n    because murder was happening before his eyes.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Love</h2>\n    <p>Larkin Poe bring a lot of naked emotion to their set; one song was about their grandfather’s mental-health issues, and a lot\n    of the between-songs patter was about how we really have to be kind to each other, more than ever in these troubled times, one\n    time with a callout to that start-of-show incident.</p>\n    <p>I think the not-terribly-common combination of being women-centered and playing uncompromising hardasss electric music\n    empowers them to open up emotionally in a way that might be harder for other gender/genre combinations. I enjoyed it.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/04/PXL_20230204_062731115.png\" alt=\"Rebecca and Lovell of Larkin Poe taking a guitar solo\"/>    \n    <h2 id='p-4'>The music</h2>\n    <p>Rebecca is a fine Rock singer and both sisters are really accomplished guitarists. I enjoyed the songs\n    they wrote themselves, in particular <cite>She’s a Self-Made Man</cite> and <cite>Bad Spell</cite>, the latter introduced as a reply to\n    Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/201x/2018/03/18/SotD-I-Put-A-Spell-On-You\">I Put a Spell On You</a> (that link is to a blog fragment about\n    that song).</p>\n    <p>But probably my favorite number was their cover of Son Volt’s <cite>Preachin’ Blues</cite>, because of Megan’s big intro, the\n    knife-edged scream coming off that guitar of hers made my whole body shiver. They also do a number called <cite>Wanted\n    Woman</cite> which is a somewhat-twisted cover of AC/DC’s <cite>Wanted Man</cite>. It was great.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/04/PXL_20230204_063905892.png\" alt=\"Megan Lovell of Larkin Poe taking a slide-guitar solo\"/>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/04/PXL_20230204_063849400.png\" alt=\"Megan Lovell of Larkin Poe taking a slide-guitar solo\"/>\n    <p>I was a little disappointed they didn’t do an acoustic set or even song. Like a whole bunch of other people, I became a\n    Larkin Poe fan during the pandemic because of the\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOawz4pB8d284K1jCus1g7AfNfVbrBqI\">Larkin Poe Cover Channel</a>, just\n    the two sisters sitting side-by-side and covering classics, doing a really great job on every one I bothered to watch. Follow that link\n    and you’ll be rolling your eyes at the song selection. I recommend\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8ubMA3ifno\">The Peter Gunn Theme</a> and\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-tp854XTJ8&amp;list=PLUOawz4pB8d284K1jCus1g7AfNfVbrBqI&amp;index=77\">Day Tripper</a>  and\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldOCdxtKTI4\">Sharp Dressed Man</a> and (OMG have a hanky handy)\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoMG0UtAVak\">Wicked Game</a>.</p>\n    <p>They were apparently using an excellent microphone because those covers are just wonderful listening, especially the capture\n    of the slide-guitar grain, like you’re almost never gonna get from a live PA.\n    Um, maybe don’t visit that channel just now if you have things you need to get accomplished in the next hour or so?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Sound!</h2>\n    <p>While the live sound didn’t capture the texture and detail of a good mike pointed at intimate acoustic music, it was really\n    freaking awesome. Which it isn’t always in the Commodore (<i>cough</i> Jack White <i>cough</i>).</p>\n    <p>The vocals were crystal clear, you could easily understand the lyrics, the guitars howled and\n    roared but didn’t have that painful high-end scrape; you could always tell who was playing just by the tone. Megan\n    gets most of the soloing spotlight with that heavy slide sound, but Rebecca played some pretty great breaks too, particularly\n    tasty stuff down in the middle and bottom of the instrument’s range, in no hurry to go up the neck for the high notes.</p>\n    <p>I thought maybe the most impressive thing was the great song arrangements. It wasn’t just verse / chorus / verse / chorus /\n    solo / bridge / verse / chorus; there were lots of opportunities for double breaks and band-dropouts and big-chord frenzies and\n    so on, no two songs the same. Best thing was when they telegraphed “Big riff coming in 3-2-1” and oooh, they were some\n    <em>nice</em> riffs.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>Commercial</h2>\n    <p>On Larkin Poe’s most recent album <cite>Blood Harmony</cite> there’s a nice song called <cite>Southern Comfort</cite>. The\n    drink is sponsoring the tour, and before they played the song they did a little commercial; one of the roadies came on stage\n    with a tray, little shot glasses for each band member, so they thanked the brand for the sponsorship and drank a toast to the\n    crowd. (Just “Cheers!”)</p>\n    <p>That’s a little weird, but it was short and unobtrusive and it’s hard to be against anything that gets musicians paid.  If I\n    were in the band I’d have told them to fill the glass with water because I loathe that stuff, it’s awful.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Health</h2>\n    <p>I attended the show by myself (my usual date under the weather) so I went down by the front of the stage.  I was wearing a\n    mask, like… maybe 2% of the others.</p>\n    <p>People, what is wrong with you?! We’re losing our elders and the most vulnerable to Covid at a horrifying rate, the\n    prevalence of Long Covid is creeping up, and we keep hearing bad news about all sorts of nasty permanent damage the virus can\n    do, including to your brain.  So you’re going to go stand among hundreds of strangers and leap around, breathing heavily, with\n    no mask on?  I just don’t get it.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>I know, it’s only rock and roll…</h2>\n    <p>But I like it, like it, yes I do.</p>\n</div></content></entry>",

I recommend\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8ubMA3ifno\">The Peter Gunn Theme</a> and\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-tp854XTJ8&amp;list=PLUOawz4pB8d284K1jCus1g7AfNfVbrBqI&amp;index=77\">Day Tripper</a>  and\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldOCdxtKTI4\">Sharp Dressed Man</a> and (OMG have a hanky handy)\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoMG0UtAVak\">Wicked Game</a>.</p>\n    <p>They were apparently using an excellent microphone because those covers are just wonderful listening, especially the capture\n    of the slide-guitar grain, like you’re almost never gonna get from a live PA.\n    Um, maybe don’t visit that channel just now if you have things you need to get accomplished in the next hour or so?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Sound!</h2>\n    <p>While the live sound didn’t capture the texture and detail of a good mike pointed at intimate acoustic music, it was really\n    freaking awesome. Which it isn’t always in the Commodore (<i>cough</i> Jack White <i>cough</i>).</p>\n    <p>The vocals were crystal clear, you could easily understand the lyrics, the guitars howled and\n    roared but didn’t have that painful high-end scrape; you could always tell who was playing just by the tone. Megan\n    gets most of the soloing spotlight with that heavy slide sound, but Rebecca played some pretty great breaks too, particularly\n    tasty stuff down in the middle and bottom of the instrument’s range, in no hurry to go up the neck for the high notes.</p>\n    <p>I thought maybe the most impressive thing was the great song arrangements. It wasn’t just verse / chorus / verse / chorus /\n    solo / bridge / verse / chorus; there were lots of opportunities for double breaks and band-dropouts and big-chord frenzies and\n    so on, no two songs the same. Best thing was when they telegraphed “Big riff coming in 3-2-1” and oooh, they were some\n    <em>nice</em> riffs.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>Commercial</h2>\n    <p>On Larkin Poe’s most recent album <cite>Blood Harmony</cite> there’s a nice song called <cite>Southern Comfort</cite>. The\n    drink is sponsoring the tour, and before they played the song they did a little commercial; one of the roadies came on stage\n    with a tray, little shot glasses for each band member, so they thanked the brand for the sponsorship and drank a toast to the\n    crowd. (Just “Cheers!”)</p>\n    <p>That’s a little weird, but it was short and unobtrusive and it’s hard to be against anything that gets musicians paid.  If I\n    were in the band I’d have told them to fill the glass with water because I loathe that stuff, it’s awful.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Health</h2>\n    <p>I attended the show by myself (my usual date under the weather) so I went down by the front of the stage.  I was wearing a\n    mask, like… maybe 2% of the others.</p>\n    <p>People, what is wrong with you?! We’re losing our elders and the most vulnerable to Covid at a horrifying rate, the\n    prevalence of Long Covid is creeping up, and we keep hearing bad news about all sorts of nasty permanent damage the virus can\n    do, including to your brain.  So you’re going to go stand among hundreds of strangers and leap around, breathing heavily, with\n    no mask on?  I just don’t get it.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>I know, it’s only rock and roll…</h2>\n    <p>But I like it, like it, yes I do.</p>\n</div>",

        "content": "<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>\n    <p>I’ve just finished setting up a new Mac (14\" MBP, M2 Pro, 32G, 4T). It dawned on me that most of my really intense\n    interactions with this thing involve looking at “monospace” (i.e. fixed-width) text; in Emacs where I write this blog, in\n    my IDE, and in my terminal.  The ones that came with the machine by default are, well, OK, but maybe we can do better.  So I got\n    on Mastodon and \n    <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@timbray/109837766746088431\">asked</a>: “Dear LazyWeb: Setting up a new Mac, what are some\n    groovy new monospace fonts for terminals and IDEs?”</p>\n    <p><i>[Update: This got a gazillion views and comments, the latter mostly along the lines of “you left out my favorite font!”\n    So I\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/202x/2023/02/14/More-Mono\">wrote a follow-up</a> with lots more fonts!]</i></p>\n    <p>Which was like throwing raw meat into the piranha\n    pool. Obviously this is something that geeks care about deeply. I got a huge number of suggestions, of which I downloaded 16, basically\n    all the ones that are free. In general I prefer to pay for things and am suspicious of anything that’s free on the Net, but\n    when there are so many good free options I just don’t think there’s a business model.</p>\n    <p>Disclosure: In recent years I’ve been using\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata\">Inconsolata</a>, which has always pleased my eye, and also is the only font\n    whose inventor I’ve met; I admire\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Levien\">Raph Levien</a> extremely. Can I replace it?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Method</h2>\n    <p>I loaded up the man page for ls(1) in the MacOS Terminal program, with size set to 18pt. By doing so I’m bypassing one\n    important criterion: Readability at small size. I suspect that an increasing proportion of geeks, like me, in this era of\n    27-inch-and-up 4K screens, don’t really squish the letters the way we did when we were twentysomethings on screens with only a\n    million dots. But if you still do, this piece probably won’t help you that much.</p>\n    <p>So let’s run through those screenshots. I’ll switch Emacs into each font as I write about it. I’ll pick the ones that I think\n    are generally the most pleasing and do another screenshot of a moderately complex chunk of Go code as presented by JetBrains’\n    excellent <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/go/\">GoLand</a> IDE.</p>\n    <p>Here they are, in alphabetical order.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>B612 Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://b612-font.com\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"b612.png\" alt=\"B612 Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>Originally commissioned by Airbus as an<br/>“Aeronautical Font” for use on aircraft cockpit\n    screens.</p></div>\n    <p>It has a few lower-case serifs, reasonably done. It’s little more vertically dense than my eyes like. Could live with\n    it. Doesn’t advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Droid Sans Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(typeface)\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"droid-sans.png\" alt=\"Droid Sans Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>Commissioned by Google in 2007,<br/>said to be optimized for small handset screens.</p></div>\n    <p>I lived in this typeface when I was in the Android group 2010-12. It’s perfectly OK but just uses too much horizontal space\n    for me. While it looks nice in my Emacs buffer, it fails at the information-density bar and doesn’t advance.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Fira Code and Fira Code Retina</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">here</a></p>\n    <img src=\"fira.png\" alt=\"Fira Code\" />\n    <img src=\"fira-retina.png\" alt=\"Fira Code Retina\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>“Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters.

Its big selling point is a set of\n    ligatures, like “≠” for “!=”. Meh; all these years in, my eyes don’t care.</p>\n    <p>For a font that doesn’t market its typographic values much, it sure pleases my eye; light, clear, well balanced horizontally\n    and vertically.</p>\n    <p>It comes with an ordinary selection of styles: Normal, Light, and so on. But then there’s also “Retina”. It’s difficult to\n    find an explanation; one assumes some sort of optimization for high pixel density? Anyhow, it makes me happy; just the tiniest\n    bit of extra weight that to my eye makes each character speak its nature a little louder.</p>\n    <p>The Retina style advances.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Go Mono</h2>\n    <p>Start\n    <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/go-fonts\">here</a>.</p>\n    <img src=\"go.png\" alt=\"Go Mono\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>By Bigelow &amp; Holmes.</p></div>\n    <p>Wow, so many serifs. That strikes me as inconsistent with Go’s design aesthetic, which eschews decoration and fancy features.\n    Also, it is notably more vertically compact than the average, which makes my Emacs editing screen look cramped; in code,\n    which typically has shorter lines, that’s probably not so much of an issue?</p>\n    <p>Advance to the next round? Honestly, probably not.

Gotta keep doing\n    some coding to keep me honest!\n    The purpose of today’s piece is to provide a snapshot status report and record a few\n    technology gripes just to get them off my chest; sharing is caring.</p>\n    <p>I built Quamina v0.1.0; since\n    then, it’s had help from others. Thanks especially to\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/jsmorph\">Jamie</a>,\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/embano1\">Micha</a>, and\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/yosiat\">Yosi</a>.\n    I peeked back in history and the first project check-in was January 24, 2022, so that’s a year and a day from idea to\n    stability. Too slow! I’d be\n    mad if Quamina weren’t a hobby.\n    People who are interested in Event-Driven software and/or high-performance Go might find a trip through my\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/\">Quamina Diary</a> posts instructive.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>What does “v1.0.0” mean?</h2>\n    <p>That we think it’s well-enough tested, that there’s enough there to be useful, and that we promise to change the APIs only\n    additively.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Recent news</h2>\n    <p>The biggest Quamina-related news was AWS’s\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/202x/2022/09/02/Hello-Ruler\">release of AWS Event Ruler</a> (“Ruler” for short), a similar\n    event-filtering library written in Java that I bootstrapped while at AWS. Thanks to Usman and Shawn and especially Rishi for\n    getting the open-sourcing done; I suspect this will end up being heavily used in the community.</p>\n    <p>The intent is that Java and Quamina should be\n    compatible. At the moment, Ruler supports more pattern flavors, so Quamina\n    needs to catch up.  On the other hand, Quamina is (at least on a few common Patterns) quite a bit faster.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Checklist</h2>\n    <p>Here are the things we did to make Quamina ready for v1.0.0:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Yosi made Quamina much smarter about not looking at parts of events that can’t match any\n      Patterns. You don’t get speedups for every Pattern combination, but you often get dramatic results.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Micha did a mountain of work getting our CI/CD sorted out, fighting stupid GitHub problems, keeping me from doing\n      stupid Git things and helping me recover when I did them anyhow.</p>\n      <p>Behind the BigCo firewall, I’d never taken a serious look at GitHub’s CI/CD/release tooling<span class='dashes'> —</span> it’d\n      be fair to say I’ve been a bit behind the times on that stuff<span class='dashes'> —</span> so this was super-educational for\n      me.</p> \n      </li>\n      <li><p>Micha and I figured out how to give Quamina a vanity-domain home, so Quamina’s import is now\n      <code>quamina.net/go/quamina</code>.  This is promoted as a best practice and most people are too polite to clarify that it’s\n      a declaration of independence from GitHub, in case they go sour.</p>\n      <p>Thanks also to my wife Lauren for setting up\n      <code>quamina.net</code> on her basic hosting provider.</p></li>\n      <li><p>I adapted a couple of Ruler’s unit tests; useful for making sure we’re compatible, for comparing performance, and one of\n      them even snagged an un-caught bug.</p></li>\n      <li><p>I made a pass over the code, killed a bunch of TODOs and bad comment grammar, and wired in a couple easy optimizations.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Did I mention “fast”?</h2>\n    <p>All this whittling away and in particular Yosi’s work now have Quamina processing certain common event-matching tasks at way\n    over 1.5 million Events/sec on my mouldy old Intel MacBook Pro.  Yow!</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Next steps</h2>\n    <p>The next wave of work is mostly straightforward: Making Quamina more Ruler-compatible by adding lots of new patterns like\n    monocase matching, numeric expressions, and eventually full wild-carding.</p>\n    <p>Also, there’s a lingering bug where if you add too many of Quamina’s “shellstyle” Patterns, the size of the finite automaton\n    explodes in a stupid way<span class='dashes'> —</span> it still\n    works, just burns a lot of memory<span class='dashes'> —</span> that annoys the hell out of me and will be hard to debug. But I\n    will.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Gripe: GitHub commit signing</h2>\n    <p>What a great idea! You can get people to sign their commits with a public key they upload, which makes paranoids like me\n    happy. Then you can turn on branch-protection to allow only signed commits.</p>\n    <p>But in practice, it’s pretty useless, because the CI\n    bots like Dependabot don’t sign commits.  GitHub doesn’t even sign when you ask it to bring a slightly-out-of-date PR into sync\n    with the current repo state.

Gotta keep doing\n    some coding to keep me honest!\n    The purpose of today’s piece is to provide a snapshot status report and record a few\n    technology gripes just to get them off my chest; sharing is caring.</p>\n    <p>I built Quamina v0.1.0; since\n    then, it’s had help from others. Thanks especially to\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/jsmorph\">Jamie</a>,\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/embano1\">Micha</a>, and\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/yosiat\">Yosi</a>.\n    I peeked back in history and the first project check-in was January 24, 2022, so that’s a year and a day from idea to\n    stability. Too slow! I’d be\n    mad if Quamina weren’t a hobby.\n    People who are interested in Event-Driven software and/or high-performance Go might find a trip through my\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/What/Technology/Quamina%20Diary/\">Quamina Diary</a> posts instructive.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>What does “v1.0.0” mean?</h2>\n    <p>That we think it’s well-enough tested, that there’s enough there to be useful, and that we promise to change the APIs only\n    additively.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Recent news</h2>\n    <p>The biggest Quamina-related news was AWS’s\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/202x/2022/09/02/Hello-Ruler\">release of AWS Event Ruler</a> (“Ruler” for short), a similar\n    event-filtering library written in Java that I bootstrapped while at AWS. Thanks to Usman and Shawn and especially Rishi for\n    getting the open-sourcing done; I suspect this will end up being heavily used in the community.</p>\n    <p>The intent is that Java and Quamina should be\n    compatible. At the moment, Ruler supports more pattern flavors, so Quamina\n    needs to catch up.  On the other hand, Quamina is (at least on a few common Patterns) quite a bit faster.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Checklist</h2>\n    <p>Here are the things we did to make Quamina ready for v1.0.0:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Yosi made Quamina much smarter about not looking at parts of events that can’t match any\n      Patterns. You don’t get speedups for every Pattern combination, but you often get dramatic results.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Micha did a mountain of work getting our CI/CD sorted out, fighting stupid GitHub problems, keeping me from doing\n      stupid Git things and helping me recover when I did them anyhow.</p>\n      <p>Behind the BigCo firewall, I’d never taken a serious look at GitHub’s CI/CD/release tooling<span class='dashes'> —</span> it’d\n      be fair to say I’ve been a bit behind the times on that stuff<span class='dashes'> —</span> so this was super-educational for\n      me.</p> \n      </li>\n      <li><p>Micha and I figured out how to give Quamina a vanity-domain home, so Quamina’s import is now\n      <code>quamina.net/go/quamina</code>.  This is promoted as a best practice and most people are too polite to clarify that it’s\n      a declaration of independence from GitHub, in case they go sour.</p>\n      <p>Thanks also to my wife Lauren for setting up\n      <code>quamina.net</code> on her basic hosting provider.</p></li>\n      <li><p>I adapted a couple of Ruler’s unit tests; useful for making sure we’re compatible, for comparing performance, and one of\n      them even snagged an un-caught bug.</p></li>\n      <li><p>I made a pass over the code, killed a bunch of TODOs and bad comment grammar, and wired in a couple easy optimizations.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>Did I mention “fast”?</h2>\n    <p>All this whittling away and in particular Yosi’s work now have Quamina processing certain common event-matching tasks at way\n    over 1.5 million Events/sec on my mouldy old Intel MacBook Pro.  Yow!</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Next steps</h2>\n    <p>The next wave of work is mostly straightforward: Making Quamina more Ruler-compatible by adding lots of new patterns like\n    monocase matching, numeric expressions, and eventually full wild-carding.</p>\n    <p>Also, there’s a lingering bug where if you add too many of Quamina’s “shellstyle” Patterns, the size of the finite automaton\n    explodes in a stupid way<span class='dashes'> —</span> it still\n    works, just burns a lot of memory<span class='dashes'> —</span> that annoys the hell out of me and will be hard to debug. But I\n    will.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Gripe: GitHub commit signing</h2>\n    <p>What a great idea! You can get people to sign their commits with a public key they upload, which makes paranoids like me\n    happy. Then you can turn on branch-protection to allow only signed commits.</p>\n    <p>But in practice, it’s pretty useless, because the CI\n    bots like Dependabot don’t sign commits.  GitHub doesn’t even sign when you ask it to bring a slightly-out-of-date PR into sync\n    with the current repo state.  Blecch.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Gripe: Git generally</h2>\n    <p>In all those years at Google and Amazon, I used git but both places wrapped it in so much automation that you never really\n    needed anything more than add, commit, and push; damn few options required on any of them.  Being generally lazy, I never\n    bothered to learn more than the bare minimum.</p>\n    <p>Out there in the wilder world of GitHub, you have to know a whole lot more and, while I admire Git’s power, flexibility, and\n    performance, I have to say I loathe the experience of using it.

The DSA presented a <em>very</em> class-centric position: That the murder was a consequence of class\n    oppression and that socialists such as the DSA were thus uniquely qualified to address the problem.</p>\n    <p>You don’t have to be a Political Science Ph.D to notice that Floyd’s murder was a racist act that can only be understood in a\n    racism-aware framework, and that omitting that dimension is clueless.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, ignoring the class dimension of oppression in general, racism in particular, and George Floyd’s murder in\n    particular particular,\n    would also be clueless.  Mr Floyd was a man with a bunch of problems, but one of the biggest was that he was broke.</p> \n    <h2 id='p-2'>Dive deeper</h2>\n    <p>Anyhow, I’m not going to get too far into theory arguments because, as I argue below, I don’t think they make much\n    difference in which political policies we ought to support.  But it’s an interesting conversation, so here’s a\n    short reading list that I think is both educational and fascinating.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/01/16/Adolph-Reed.png\" alt=\"Professor Adolph L.

Professor Reed seems to be upstream from a lot of this debate, and goes so far as to question the\n        value of much “antiracism” in practice. I’m not always 100% convinced, but the man is eloquent and erudite.</p></li>\n      <li><p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/the-marxist-who-antagonizes-liberals-and-the-left\">The Marxist Who\n        Antagonizes Liberals and the Left</a>, in the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, covers Prof. Reed and his ideas and history and\n        writings pretty thoroughly. Once again, I’m not a disciple, but his line of argument is never not stimulating.</p></li>\n        <li><p>In the <cite>NYTimes</cite>, check out\n        <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/adolph-reed-controversy.html\">A Black Marxist Scholar Wanted to Talk About\n        Race. It Ignited a Fury.</a>\n        It’s about what the title says: How Prof. Reed’s ideas led to a hideous melt-down when the NYC DSA branch\n        invited him to give a speech. Opponents accused him of being “reactionary, class reductionist and at best, tone deaf”; the\n        event was canceled. Both sides of the debate are interesting. </p></li>\n        <li><p><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/25/how-calling-someone-a-class-reductionist-became-a-lefty-insult/\">That\n        <cite>Salon</cite> piece by Asad Haider</a> that I linked above. Once it gets past the Floyd episode, it digs pretty deep into\n        all the stuff in this list; I found it nuanced and eye-opening.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Intersectionality</h2>\n    <p>What schools of thought are in opposition to Class Reductionism? The three I hear mentioned are “Identity\n    Politics”, “Postmodernism”, and “Intersectionality”. I never understood what the first meant and anyhow it’s just a\n    right-wing culture-warrior battle-cry now. “Postmodernism”… I mean, in 2023, who cares.</p>\n    <p>Intersectionality, though, is one of the more interesting new-ish things in progressive thought; it’s simple enough and seems\n    self-evidently true. Oppression isn’t one-dimensional, but operates along axes including race and gender and age and disability,\n    and not always in simple ways.</p>\n    <p>Let me put it another way: Traditional patriarchial thinking is built around the notion of the default “standard” person, who is\n    a straight white heterosexual neurotypical fully-abled cis male. To the extent that any person varies from “standard”, they are\n    disadvantaged and likely oppressed.</p>\n    <p>And another way: A Black trans woman with a disability is likely to have an extremely difficult life, at no\n    fault of her own.</p>\n    <p>Intersectionality issues a challenge: It’s neither ethical nor effective to try to solve just one of these problems, because\n    they combine in complicated ways.    It’s a\n    school of thought that causes eye-rolling on the right and is held at a distance by some old-school leftists. Which puzzles me\n    because it seems so self-evidently empirically true.</p>\n    <p>And yet… in the first paragraph above, I said friendly things about the policies a “class reductionist” might advance. How so?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>It’s about the money</h2>\n    <p>Let’s return to that Black trans woman with a disability I mentioned above. The forces which affect her are complex, but one\n    of the results is highly predictable: She’s probably broke, possibly to the point of food or shelter insecurity.  Life (and\n    intersectionality) are complex, but money is, relatively speaking, simple. As a society, there’s plenty of it to go around but\n    it’s distributed stupidly, unjustly, and inefficiently.  And it’s getting worse.</p>\n    <p>In Vancouver, the insanely rich city where I live, Teslas and\n    Lamborghinis are common as dirt, but our Food Banks are \n    <a href=\"https://bc.ctvnews.ca/never-seen-anything-like-this-greater-vancouver-food-bank-demand-skyrockets-1.6190255\">facing\n    skyrocketing demand</a>, and there’s a constant struggle to feed the kids who\n    <a href=\"https://vansunkidsfund.ca\">come to school hungry</a>.</p>\n    <p>Let me hand the mike to\n    <a href=\"https://sarahsmarsh.com\">Sarah Smarsh</a>, a writer with an unusually deep understanding of the American poverty she\n    grew up in (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sarah_Smarsh/status/1328432469813710849\">link</a>):</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/01/16/Smarsh.png\" alt=\"Tweet by Sarah Smarsh: “What causes poverty?” “Being born poor.” “How do we solve poverty?” “Give people money.”\" />\n    <p>And then, here’s the paper that led to me writing this long-gestating piece. It’s\n    <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00733\">Effects Of The 2021 Expanded Child Tax Credit On Adults’\n    Mental Health: A Quasi-Experimental Study</a> in <cite>Health Affairs</cite> by Batra, Jackson, and Harnad, all from UCSF’s\n    <a href=\"https://sphere.ucsf.edu/our-research-team\">Social Policies for Health Equity Research Program</a> research team.\n    Here’s most of the abstract:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The US Congress temporarily expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide economic assistance\n      for families with children. Although formerly the CTC provided $2,000 per child for mostly middle-income parents, during\n      July–December 2021 it provided up to $3,600 per child. Eligibility criteria were also expanded to reach more economically\n      disadvantaged families …\n      we examined the effects of the\n      expanded CTC on mental health and related outcomes among low-income adults with children, and by racial and ethnic\n      subgroup. We found fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms among low-income adults. Adults of Black, Hispanic, and other racial\n      and ethnic backgrounds demonstrated greater reductions in anxiety symptoms compared to non-Hispanic White adults with\n      children …</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>We mustn’t stop working hard to disentangle and remediate the messy intersectional vectors of oppression.  But while we do\n    that, something along the lines of a Unversal Basic Income routes around that mess\n    and<span class='dashes'> —</span> yes, granted<span class='dashes'> —</span> focuses on treating oppression’s symptoms. But… why\n    not?</p>\n    <p>I’d go further. I’d put the goal of getting money flowing to the oppressed at the front of the queue. It’s a policy\n    that has the virtue of being simple and easy to understand and easy to explain and, based on the evidence from a variety of\n    Universal-Basic-Income studies, has results that are beneficial and not very hard to measure.</p>\n    <p>It will of course require a ferocious political struggle against the moneyed patriarchal interests for whom current society\n    is ticking along just fine, ignoring of course the hungry kids coming to school and the people being killed by\n    police over crimes which range from petty to nonexistent.</p>\n    <p>Time to get on board with that struggle!</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>But racism!</h2>\n    <p>Anyone who makes these kinds of arguments is at risk of being accused of looking away from the glaringly obvious racism which\n    seems to inhabit the white-hot center of the intersectional tangle of oppression. Especially when that “anyone” is someone like me, a\n    “standard” human per the criteria listed above, possibly blinded by my own whiteness.</p>\n    <p>I don’t have anything cheerful to say. I try to be antiracist, a good ally, but I don’t think I’m good at it. And I don’t think\n    we’re going to break racism’s back in this generation or the next. I’ve come to believe that humanity, as a species, has a\n    hard-wired predisposition for tribal behavior,\n    for hating (and given the chance, casually killing) the people who live <em>over there</em> and speak with <em>that accent</em> and\n    eat <em>that meat</em> and worship <em>that god</em>.</p>\n    <p>My prediction is that if our civilization survives another couple of centuries we’ll do better. But we’ll still need\n    a strong early-education focus to bend young minds away from tribalism and toward intercultural\n    harmony. Antiracism will never end.</p>\n    <p>And, apologizing in advance for negativity, I think it’s not just me who’s bad at antiracism; we as a society generally suck\n    at it.  I speak as a veteran of years of involvement in corporate DEI programs and donations to worthy charitable causes and\n    signing the right petitions.</p>\n    <p>We have in my lifetime developed an increasingly accurate perception of the pervasiveness of\n    bigotry, but done a miserable job of alleviating it. I’m optimistic that we’ll get better at\n    it<span class='dashes'> —</span> one lifespan is a pretty short time to develop approaches and tools. But I am in no way\n    inclined to put other urgent measures on hold while we work it out.</p> \n    <p>Given the above, it seems both ethical and urgent to focus <em>right now</em> on doing our best to make sure that everyone can\n    count on being fed, clothed, and sheltered.</p>\n    <p>Among other things, the oppressed people should have a leadership role in fighting oppression, and that’s just not going to\n    happen if they’re putting all their effort into making the rent and feeding their kids.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/01/16/marx-pillow.png\" alt=\"Pillow with Karl Marx cartoon\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>A wide selection of Karl Marx cushions<br/>is available at\n    <a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/throw-pillows/karl-marx\">TeePublic</a>; this one is by\n    <a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/user/shiny-store\">Gaby Shiny</a>.</p></div>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Marxism?</h2>\n    <p>You can’t really take this kind of angle without acknowledging that you’re talking about class, which means you’re a Marxist,\n    right? And indeed, Marxists, from pedantic academics to hard-ass tankies, are at one in explaining how class\n    transcends issues of race and gender, and that fighting for the working class implies attacking multiple other vectors of\n    oppression. And they have a point.</p>\n    <p>So I can get along with the Marxist take as long as prioritizing anti-poverty doesn’t mean you think you’re automatically\n    antiracist or can postpone addressing the other flavors of oppression.  And thinking about social\n    problems through the lens of class seems like a powerfully useful tool for understanding the social problems we’re trying to\n    fix.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>What am I then?</h2>\n    <p>I wish there were a convenient label to describe the perceptions that I’ve described here. Which is to say, I’m unlikely to\n    deploy a “classreductionist.org” Web site any time soon.</p>\n    <p>I think of slogans like “Prioritize Poverty” and “Send Money Now”.</p>\n    <p>But for the moment, I don’t know what domain name I should buy. Maybe I’m a Smarshian?\n    A Reedite?</p>\n    <p>What I really believe is “Send money. Start now.” But that’s a lousy label.</p>\n\n    <!--\n    <p>(Don’t believe the ruling class is that smart or well-organized tbh - but politicians without any moral values (yes, I am\n    talking about Republicans) have been perfectly willing to go racist to get those votes, even when they may not racist\n    themselves; the most common motive is to advance the right-wing agenda of promoting less taxation and regulation.)</p>\n    <p>Is class a category or a symptom?</p>-->\n\n</div></content></entry>",

And while I wouldn’t either, I’m pretty sure I’d support the key policy goals\n    that a hypothetical Class Reductionist would.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Definitions and argumentations</h2>\n    <p>Let’s start with the \n    <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Class%20Reductionism\">Urban Dictionary’s</a>:\n    “The idea in some leftist circles that all\n    oppression based on gender, sex, race, etc. is just a byproduct of class struggle, and that once class disparity is solved, all\n    those issues will vanish.”</p>\n    <p><cite>Salon</cite> goes deeper in Asad Haider’s\n    <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/25/how-calling-someone-a-class-reductionist-became-a-lefty-insult/\">How calling someone\n    a “class reductionist” became a lefty insult</a>.\n    Specifically, it calls out the DSA Philadelphia Chapter\n    statement on the murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis\n    Police. The DSA presented a <em>very</em> class-centric position: That the murder was a consequence of class\n    oppression and that socialists such as the DSA were thus uniquely qualified to address the problem.</p>\n    <p>You don’t have to be a Political Science Ph.D to notice that Floyd’s murder was a racist act that can only be understood in a\n    racism-aware framework, and that omitting that dimension is clueless.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, ignoring the class dimension of oppression in general, racism in particular, and George Floyd’s murder in\n    particular particular,\n    would also be clueless.  Mr Floyd was a man with a bunch of problems, but one of the biggest was that he was broke.</p> \n    <h2 id='p-2'>Dive deeper</h2>\n    <p>Anyhow, I’m not going to get too far into theory arguments because, as I argue below, I don’t think they make much\n    difference in which political policies we ought to support.  But it’s an interesting conversation, so here’s a\n    short reading list that I think is both educational and fascinating.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/01/16/Adolph-Reed.png\" alt=\"Professor Adolph L.

Professor Reed seems to be upstream from a lot of this debate, and goes so far as to question the\n        value of much “antiracism” in practice. I’m not always 100% convinced, but the man is eloquent and erudite.</p></li>\n      <li><p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/the-marxist-who-antagonizes-liberals-and-the-left\">The Marxist Who\n        Antagonizes Liberals and the Left</a>, in the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, covers Prof. Reed and his ideas and history and\n        writings pretty thoroughly. Once again, I’m not a disciple, but his line of argument is never not stimulating.</p></li>\n        <li><p>In the <cite>NYTimes</cite>, check out\n        <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/us/adolph-reed-controversy.html\">A Black Marxist Scholar Wanted to Talk About\n        Race. It Ignited a Fury.</a>\n        It’s about what the title says: How Prof. Reed’s ideas led to a hideous melt-down when the NYC DSA branch\n        invited him to give a speech. Opponents accused him of being “reactionary, class reductionist and at best, tone deaf”; the\n        event was canceled. Both sides of the debate are interesting. </p></li>\n        <li><p><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/07/25/how-calling-someone-a-class-reductionist-became-a-lefty-insult/\">That\n        <cite>Salon</cite> piece by Asad Haider</a> that I linked above. Once it gets past the Floyd episode, it digs pretty deep into\n        all the stuff in this list; I found it nuanced and eye-opening.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Intersectionality</h2>\n    <p>What schools of thought are in opposition to Class Reductionism? The three I hear mentioned are “Identity\n    Politics”, “Postmodernism”, and “Intersectionality”. I never understood what the first meant and anyhow it’s just a\n    right-wing culture-warrior battle-cry now. “Postmodernism”… I mean, in 2023, who cares.</p>\n    <p>Intersectionality, though, is one of the more interesting new-ish things in progressive thought; it’s simple enough and seems\n    self-evidently true. Oppression isn’t one-dimensional, but operates along axes including race and gender and age and disability,\n    and not always in simple ways.</p>\n    <p>Let me put it another way: Traditional patriarchial thinking is built around the notion of the default “standard” person, who is\n    a straight white heterosexual neurotypical fully-abled cis male. To the extent that any person varies from “standard”, they are\n    disadvantaged and likely oppressed.</p>\n    <p>And another way: A Black trans woman with a disability is likely to have an extremely difficult life, at no\n    fault of her own.</p>\n    <p>Intersectionality issues a challenge: It’s neither ethical nor effective to try to solve just one of these problems, because\n    they combine in complicated ways.    It’s a\n    school of thought that causes eye-rolling on the right and is held at a distance by some old-school leftists. Which puzzles me\n    because it seems so self-evidently empirically true.</p>\n    <p>And yet… in the first paragraph above, I said friendly things about the policies a “class reductionist” might advance. How so?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>It’s about the money</h2>\n    <p>Let’s return to that Black trans woman with a disability I mentioned above. The forces which affect her are complex, but one\n    of the results is highly predictable: She’s probably broke, possibly to the point of food or shelter insecurity.  Life (and\n    intersectionality) are complex, but money is, relatively speaking, simple. As a society, there’s plenty of it to go around but\n    it’s distributed stupidly, unjustly, and inefficiently.  And it’s getting worse.</p>\n    <p>In Vancouver, the insanely rich city where I live, Teslas and\n    Lamborghinis are common as dirt, but our Food Banks are \n    <a href=\"https://bc.ctvnews.ca/never-seen-anything-like-this-greater-vancouver-food-bank-demand-skyrockets-1.6190255\">facing\n    skyrocketing demand</a>, and there’s a constant struggle to feed the kids who\n    <a href=\"https://vansunkidsfund.ca\">come to school hungry</a>.</p>\n    <p>Let me hand the mike to\n    <a href=\"https://sarahsmarsh.com\">Sarah Smarsh</a>, a writer with an unusually deep understanding of the American poverty she\n    grew up in (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sarah_Smarsh/status/1328432469813710849\">link</a>):</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/01/16/Smarsh.png\" alt=\"Tweet by Sarah Smarsh: “What causes poverty?” “Being born poor.” “How do we solve poverty?” “Give people money.”\" />\n    <p>And then, here’s the paper that led to me writing this long-gestating piece. It’s\n    <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.00733\">Effects Of The 2021 Expanded Child Tax Credit On Adults’\n    Mental Health: A Quasi-Experimental Study</a> in <cite>Health Affairs</cite> by Batra, Jackson, and Harnad, all from UCSF’s\n    <a href=\"https://sphere.ucsf.edu/our-research-team\">Social Policies for Health Equity Research Program</a> research team.\n    Here’s most of the abstract:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The US Congress temporarily expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide economic assistance\n      for families with children. Although formerly the CTC provided $2,000 per child for mostly middle-income parents, during\n      July–December 2021 it provided up to $3,600 per child. Eligibility criteria were also expanded to reach more economically\n      disadvantaged families …\n      we examined the effects of the\n      expanded CTC on mental health and related outcomes among low-income adults with children, and by racial and ethnic\n      subgroup. We found fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms among low-income adults. Adults of Black, Hispanic, and other racial\n      and ethnic backgrounds demonstrated greater reductions in anxiety symptoms compared to non-Hispanic White adults with\n      children …</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>We mustn’t stop working hard to disentangle and remediate the messy intersectional vectors of oppression.  But while we do\n    that, something along the lines of a Unversal Basic Income routes around that mess\n    and<span class='dashes'> —</span> yes, granted<span class='dashes'> —</span> focuses on treating oppression’s symptoms. But… why\n    not?</p>\n    <p>I’d go further. I’d put the goal of getting money flowing to the oppressed at the front of the queue. It’s a policy\n    that has the virtue of being simple and easy to understand and easy to explain and, based on the evidence from a variety of\n    Universal-Basic-Income studies, has results that are beneficial and not very hard to measure.</p>\n    <p>It will of course require a ferocious political struggle against the moneyed patriarchal interests for whom current society\n    is ticking along just fine, ignoring of course the hungry kids coming to school and the people being killed by\n    police over crimes which range from petty to nonexistent.</p>\n    <p>Time to get on board with that struggle!</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>But racism!</h2>\n    <p>Anyone who makes these kinds of arguments is at risk of being accused of looking away from the glaringly obvious racism which\n    seems to inhabit the white-hot center of the intersectional tangle of oppression. Especially when that “anyone” is someone like me, a\n    “standard” human per the criteria listed above, possibly blinded by my own whiteness.</p>\n    <p>I don’t have anything cheerful to say. I try to be antiracist, a good ally, but I don’t think I’m good at it. And I don’t think\n    we’re going to break racism’s back in this generation or the next. I’ve come to believe that humanity, as a species, has a\n    hard-wired predisposition for tribal behavior,\n    for hating (and given the chance, casually killing) the people who live <em>over there</em> and speak with <em>that accent</em> and\n    eat <em>that meat</em> and worship <em>that god</em>.</p>\n    <p>My prediction is that if our civilization survives another couple of centuries we’ll do better. But we’ll still need\n    a strong early-education focus to bend young minds away from tribalism and toward intercultural\n    harmony. Antiracism will never end.</p>\n    <p>And, apologizing in advance for negativity, I think it’s not just me who’s bad at antiracism; we as a society generally suck\n    at it.  I speak as a veteran of years of involvement in corporate DEI programs and donations to worthy charitable causes and\n    signing the right petitions.</p>\n    <p>We have in my lifetime developed an increasingly accurate perception of the pervasiveness of\n    bigotry, but done a miserable job of alleviating it. I’m optimistic that we’ll get better at\n    it<span class='dashes'> —</span> one lifespan is a pretty short time to develop approaches and tools. But I am in no way\n    inclined to put other urgent measures on hold while we work it out.</p> \n    <p>Given the above, it seems both ethical and urgent to focus <em>right now</em> on doing our best to make sure that everyone can\n    count on being fed, clothed, and sheltered.</p>\n    <p>Among other things, the oppressed people should have a leadership role in fighting oppression, and that’s just not going to\n    happen if they’re putting all their effort into making the rent and feeding their kids.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/01/16/marx-pillow.png\" alt=\"Pillow with Karl Marx cartoon\" />\n    <div class='caption'><p>A wide selection of Karl Marx cushions<br/>is available at\n    <a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/throw-pillows/karl-marx\">TeePublic</a>; this one is by\n    <a href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/user/shiny-store\">Gaby Shiny</a>.</p></div>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Marxism?</h2>\n    <p>You can’t really take this kind of angle without acknowledging that you’re talking about class, which means you’re a Marxist,\n    right? And indeed, Marxists, from pedantic academics to hard-ass tankies, are at one in explaining how class\n    transcends issues of race and gender, and that fighting for the working class implies attacking multiple other vectors of\n    oppression. And they have a point.</p>\n    <p>So I can get along with the Marxist take as long as prioritizing anti-poverty doesn’t mean you think you’re automatically\n    antiracist or can postpone addressing the other flavors of oppression.  And thinking about social\n    problems through the lens of class seems like a powerfully useful tool for understanding the social problems we’re trying to\n    fix.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>What am I then?</h2>\n    <p>I wish there were a convenient label to describe the perceptions that I’ve described here. Which is to say, I’m unlikely to\n    deploy a “classreductionist.org” Web site any time soon.</p>\n    <p>I think of slogans like “Prioritize Poverty” and “Send Money Now”.</p>\n    <p>But for the moment, I don’t know what domain name I should buy. Maybe I’m a Smarshian?\n    A Reedite?</p>\n    <p>What I really believe is “Send money. Start now.” But that’s a lousy label.</p>\n\n    <!--\n    <p>(Don’t believe the ruling class is that smart or well-organized tbh - but politicians without any moral values (yes, I am\n    talking about Republicans) have been perfectly willing to go racist to get those votes, even when they may not racist\n    themselves; the most common motive is to advance the right-wing agenda of promoting less taxation and regulation.)</p>\n    <p>Is class a category or a symptom?</p>-->\n\n</div>",

Who can build search engines, not to\n    mention ML models and adTech\n    systems and really anything else, to help the world track and follow and analyze and sell things to you.</p>\n    <p>And, if you’re vulnerable, attack you, shame you, doxx you, SWAT you, try to kill you.</p>\n    <p>The people who built Mastodon, and the ones operating large parts of it, do not want that to happen again. Full-text search\n    (with limited exceptions) has, as a matter of choice, been left out of the software. Why? Let me give the stage to:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Lead Mastodon author Eugen Rochko: <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/\">Cage the\n      Mastodon</a>, in particular the section entitled “Design decisions”.</p></li>\n      <li><p>@pamela@bsd.network:\n    <a href=\"https://bsd.network/@pamela/109287805657081451\">Hacky folks, please resist finding ways to scrape the\n      fediverse…</a>.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The good-bye message from “Fedisearch”, a few folks who ventured forth and retreated hastily:</p>\n      <p><i>Due to extreme\n      backlash from the Mastodon community we decided to end the project, it is obviously not wanted by server admins.</i></p>\n      <p><i>While our intention was to provide the end-user with a global search to find information and friends, the concerns of its\n      usage by trolls has been far greater amongst the community.</i></p></li>\n      <li><p>A couple of GitHub issues,\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/221\">Controlling availability to search</a> and\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/swicg/general/issues/3\">Socially Acceptable Search</a>, both of which have insightful\n      discussion (particularly\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/221#issuecomment-299010256\">this note from “nightpool”</a>) .</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>So, should you sally forth as related in the first paragraph above, people will say nasty things to you and tell you\n    to please stop working on your project. Should you proceed anyhow, they will take strong measures to block you and put any\n    instance you seem to represent at risk of de-federation. They’re serious.</p>\n    <p>I’m not speaking hypothetically. In the dying days of 2022 I watched in real-time as this eager young fellow bounced onto the\n    stage and said he had this new full-text thing he was about to launch, it would index all the instances your\n    instance was federated with and it was carefully built to penetrate various Mastodon blockages. And anyone who didn’t want to be\n    scraped and indexed had to opt-out. (He also claimed it was going to be available only to “genuine admins”.)</p>\n    <p>It did not go over well.  The hostility and anger among the admins was palpable, and the next day there were people following\n    up on the thread talking about de-federating the dude’s whole instance if that was the kind of person there.</p>\n    <p>This\n    <a href=\"https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html\">Open Letter from the Mastodon Community</a> is\n    another example of eager information-harvesters running into rage.</p>\n    <p>So, don’t say you weren’t warned.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Pro-search</h2>\n    <p>Perhaps you find this attitude surprising? I did, initially, and many Web veterans’ reactions range from disdainful to\n    hostile.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://cybervillains.com/@alex/109605436812933195\">Here</a> is\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Stamos\">Alex Stamos</a>: “I find the arguments against officially supported\n    Fediverse search pretty tedious, as you have to be really naive to believe that a bunch of bad-faith actors aren’t already\n    quietly archiving everything…”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://mastodon.adida.net/@ben/109605062560498288\">Here</a> is\n    <a href=\"https://ben.adida.net\">Ben Adida</a>: “I probably should then rephrase to: great search is going to happen or Fediverse\n    might well remain a niche app.”</p>\n    <p>And\n    <a href=\"https://mastinator.com\">here</a> is a project called Mastinator slamming the door on its way out: “The Fediverse has\n    some big problem coming.”</p>\n    <p>There are lots more of these reactions, and they all say more or less the same thing: “Search is good, and you can’t stop it,\n    and people are crawling your data anyhow.”</p>\n    <p>I’m a bit puzzled by that “But people are already doing it” argument.  Yes, Mastodon traffic either is already or soon\n    will be captured and filed permanently as in forever in certain government offices with addresses near Washington DC and Beijing,\n    and quite likely one or two sketchy Peter-Thiel-financed “data aggregation” companies.\n    That’s extremely hard to prevent but isn’t really the problem: The problem would be a public search engine that Gamergaters\n    and Kiwifarmers use to hunt down vulnerable targets.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-11'>What Mastodon does now</h2>\n    <p>Just to be clear, Mastodon offers a perfectly decent search capability.  You can search hashcodes, and what’s even cooler,\n    you can follow them like you do another person.  I like this but it does tend to leave too many posts #bulging #with #ugly\n    #hashcodes like a crazed corporate SEO vampire.</p>\n    <p>You can \n    <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/elasticsearch/\">search your own posts</a> and a few other useful things.\n    So it’s not as though there’s blanket condemnation of the idea of search, just a whole lot of concern about what’s allowed and\n    how it’s used.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Where I stand</h2>\n    <p>I think privacy is good and ignoring the issue is unethical.\n    People should be able to converse without their every word landing\n    on a permanent global un-erasable indexed public record. Call me crazy.</p>\n    <p>Disclosure: I’ve personally been unashamedly exuberantly public on social media since the first time I stumbled onto, um, MySpace?\n    Orkut? Can’t  remember.</p>\n    <p>I like a high-intensity stream full of well-connected voices, and I like being able to get a\n    lot of people’s attention when I have something to say that I think is important.</p>\n    <p>But my vibe shouldn’t be the only vibe on the menu. Some people just want to talk\n    about stuff with a few people, they don’t want to be influencers or to mainline the <i>zeitgeist</i>.</p>\n    <p>Some people are from groups endangered by online hate and violence, or experience  precarity such that they\n    just can’t afford to have every word on the permanent record. Some people are just shy.</p>\n    <p>I am a hyperoverentitled\n    thick-skinned white boy who can laugh publicly at online assholes without much concern for consequences.\n    It’s crazy to think that social media should be exclusively optimized for people like me.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>There are problems</h2>\n    <p>To start with, notwithstanding all the above, I’d like more search too.  That’s not a <em>big</em> problem because I think\n    there’s a path forward that’s useful \n    and still preserves the current privacy-centric Mastodon values.</p>\n    <p>Then there’s the big problem…</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Mastodon’s privacy story is terrible!</h2>\n    <p>Seriously. Unless you take special specific measures, every little snippet you post on Mastodon has a URL and anyone can\n    fetch it with a Web browser or computer program and then… well, do whatever the hell they want with it. Mastodon as it stands\n    today is not built to protect privacy.</p>\n    <p>You can get a sort of weak partial privacy if you:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Post in “Friends only” mode (which can be done per-post or as a default).</p></li>\n      <li><p>Protect your account so you get to approve or deny anyone who wants to follow you.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Get lucky, as in none of your followers republish your posts to the world or gateway them to the alt-right.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>This will <em>probably</em> keep you out of some rando’s public-search-engine experiment.</p>\n    <p>But it doesn’t matter, because the vast majority of people on Mastodon don’t understand the difference between its\n    sharing modes and probably don’t protect their account, because why should anyone have to do that?</p>\n    <p>And anyhow, we’re all…</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>Missing the point</h2>\n    <p>The point is, we’re not trying to solve a technical problem here, we’re trying to solve a <em>social</em> problem. We don’t\n    want people to do certain irritating and dangerous things with data scraped off the Fediverse.  So, when there are things that\n    people <em>can</em> do but shouldn’t, what tools do we usually apply?  Hmm… I guess when I said “social” I meant “legal”.</p>\n    <p>So here’s a question: When I\n    publish something, who is licensed to fetch it or, having fetched it, store it and process it, or having stored and processed\n    it, share the results with the world, or with an employer or customer?</p>\n    <p>Mastodon doesn’t help here. When you retrieve a post, you don’t have to log in to Mastodon first, so any terms and conditions\n    you might have agreed to don’t apply. You also don’t have to click through a terms-of-service pop-up.  When you follow somebody,\n    at no point (that I’ve seen anyhow) do you get notified of how\n    they’d like their posts to be treated.</p>\n    <p>So why shouldn’t you feel free to go ahead and share what you’ve received to the world or, if you’re a\n    Search weenie, write a program to follow people and index their posts?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-9'>Suggestions</h2>\n    <p>Stated in the most general possible way: <em>The Fediverse needs to get its\n    content-licensing shit together.</em></p>\n    <p>I have ideas about how this might be done, which I’m about to offer, but I Am Not A\n    Lawyer and I am especially not a copyright or intellectual-property specialist; so take these as lightweight amateur suggestions\n    designed only to start conversation.</p>\n    <p>Disclaimers in place, I propose the following. (Note that some of these proposals are not fully compatible with each\n    other.)</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>A server should deliver posts only to people logged into the instance, or to other instances it is federated\n      with.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Servers should deliver posts only after a click-through acknowledging the license covering those posts.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The Fediverse needs to work with IP lawyers, and maybe Creative Commons, to build a menu of licenses that\n      people can choose to apply to their posts.</p></li>\n      <li><p>When you follow someone, you should be forced to acknowledge their default content license, and re-acknowledge if and\n      when they change the default.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The choice of default content license for an instance is very important and needs to be communicated clearly in human\n      language not legal jargon, at the time of registration.</p>\n      <p>Many members of the current admin community would like it if the\n      default license were always highly restrictive such that you’d have to explicitly opt in to making your posts eligible for\n      mass harvesting. I can see their point, but if I’m building  an instance for people who get paid to be public, for example\n      journalists or DevRel people, I’d probably pick the opposite default.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The content-license menu should have a lot of options.  Some line up pretty well with Mastodon’s current categories:\n      “public”, “unlisted”, and “followers only”. But I can imagine finer-grained exclusions, such as allowing full-text indexing\n      but only for accounts on the same instance, or allowing use for search but no other applications. (No ML model building!)</p></li>\n      <li><p>I’m also pretty sure that content licensing should have a temporal component. That is to say “Yes, harvest this and use\n      it, but only for two weeks beginning now.”  Mastodon already has optional built-in scheduled post deletion\n      and this would have to be consistent with that.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure I’m missing important dimensions.  And I’m totally sure that creating the dialogues necessary to support\n    this constitute a UX designer’s nightmare.</p>\n    <p>Most important, I’m convinced that this is a conversation that the Fediverse leaders need to start having, and start having\n    now.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-10'>What success looks like</h2>\n    <p>I’d like it if nobody were ever deterred from conversing with people they know for fear that people they don’t\n    know will use their words to attack them. I’d like it to be legally difficult to put everyone’s everyday conversations to work\n    in service to the advertising industry.  I’d like to reduce the discomfort people in marginalized groups feel venturing forth\n    into public conversation.</p>\n    <p>But… I’d also like to search the world’s conversation to find out what’s happening right now. How are things going around Bakhmut?\n    How are people feeling about the latest shows in the Sierra Ferrell tour?\n    What’s being posted about the World Cup semifinal?\n    Are the British Tories about to knife another idiot leader?</p>\n    <p>And especially this: \n    How are they doing on fixing the winter power outage in \n    Saskatchewan, where my elderly mother lives? Not hypothetical; it happened the evening of December 27th, and\n    being able to track the status with Twitter search meant I didn’t have to organize an emergency intervention from two time-zones \n    away.</p>\n    <p>I’d also be interested in a certain amount of historic search: What exactly were world leaders saying around last February 24th?\n    How did they describe that new AWS feature at re:Invent 2017?  And so on; but only if I’m confident the people who posted what\n    I’m searching are comfortable with them being used this way.</p>\n    <p>I think we should be able to get there. But it’s not a technology problem.</p>\n</div></content></entry>",

Let me give the stage to:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><p>Lead Mastodon author Eugen Rochko: <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/\">Cage the\n      Mastodon</a>, in particular the section entitled “Design decisions”.</p></li>\n      <li><p>@pamela@bsd.network:\n    <a href=\"https://bsd.network/@pamela/109287805657081451\">Hacky folks, please resist finding ways to scrape the\n      fediverse…</a>.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The good-bye message from “Fedisearch”, a few folks who ventured forth and retreated hastily:</p>\n      <p><i>Due to extreme\n      backlash from the Mastodon community we decided to end the project, it is obviously not wanted by server admins.</i></p>\n      <p><i>While our intention was to provide the end-user with a global search to find information and friends, the concerns of its\n      usage by trolls has been far greater amongst the community.</i></p></li>\n      <li><p>A couple of GitHub issues,\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/221\">Controlling availability to search</a> and\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/swicg/general/issues/3\">Socially Acceptable Search</a>, both of which have insightful\n      discussion (particularly\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/221#issuecomment-299010256\">this note from “nightpool”</a>) .</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>So, should you sally forth as related in the first paragraph above, people will say nasty things to you and tell you\n    to please stop working on your project. Should you proceed anyhow, they will take strong measures to block you and put any\n    instance you seem to represent at risk of de-federation. They’re serious.</p>\n    <p>I’m not speaking hypothetically. In the dying days of 2022 I watched in real-time as this eager young fellow bounced onto the\n    stage and said he had this new full-text thing he was about to launch, it would index all the instances your\n    instance was federated with and it was carefully built to penetrate various Mastodon blockages. And anyone who didn’t want to be\n    scraped and indexed had to opt-out. (He also claimed it was going to be available only to “genuine admins”.)</p>\n    <p>It did not go over well.  The hostility and anger among the admins was palpable, and the next day there were people following\n    up on the thread talking about de-federating the dude’s whole instance if that was the kind of person there.</p>\n    <p>This\n    <a href=\"https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html\">Open Letter from the Mastodon Community</a> is\n    another example of eager information-harvesters running into rage.</p>\n    <p>So, don’t say you weren’t warned.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Pro-search</h2>\n    <p>Perhaps you find this attitude surprising? I did, initially, and many Web veterans’ reactions range from disdainful to\n    hostile.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://cybervillains.com/@alex/109605436812933195\">Here</a> is\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Stamos\">Alex Stamos</a>: “I find the arguments against officially supported\n    Fediverse search pretty tedious, as you have to be really naive to believe that a bunch of bad-faith actors aren’t already\n    quietly archiving everything…”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://mastodon.adida.net/@ben/109605062560498288\">Here</a> is\n    <a href=\"https://ben.adida.net\">Ben Adida</a>: “I probably should then rephrase to: great search is going to happen or Fediverse\n    might well remain a niche app.”</p>\n    <p>And\n    <a href=\"https://mastinator.com\">here</a> is a project called Mastinator slamming the door on its way out: “The Fediverse has\n    some big problem coming.”</p>\n    <p>There are lots more of these reactions, and they all say more or less the same thing: “Search is good, and you can’t stop it,\n    and people are crawling your data anyhow.”</p>\n    <p>I’m a bit puzzled by that “But people are already doing it” argument.  Yes, Mastodon traffic either is already or soon\n    will be captured and filed permanently as in forever in certain government offices with addresses near Washington DC and Beijing,\n    and quite likely one or two sketchy Peter-Thiel-financed “data aggregation” companies.\n    That’s extremely hard to prevent but isn’t really the problem: The problem would be a public search engine that Gamergaters\n    and Kiwifarmers use to hunt down vulnerable targets.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-11'>What Mastodon does now</h2>\n    <p>Just to be clear, Mastodon offers a perfectly decent search capability.  You can search hashcodes, and what’s even cooler,\n    you can follow them like you do another person.  I like this but it does tend to leave too many posts #bulging #with #ugly\n    #hashcodes like a crazed corporate SEO vampire.</p>\n    <p>You can \n    <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/elasticsearch/\">search your own posts</a> and a few other useful things.\n    So it’s not as though there’s blanket condemnation of the idea of search, just a whole lot of concern about what’s allowed and\n    how it’s used.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>Where I stand</h2>\n    <p>I think privacy is good and ignoring the issue is unethical.\n    People should be able to converse without their every word landing\n    on a permanent global un-erasable indexed public record. Call me crazy.</p>\n    <p>Disclosure: I’ve personally been unashamedly exuberantly public on social media since the first time I stumbled onto, um, MySpace?\n    Orkut? Can’t  remember.</p>\n    <p>I like a high-intensity stream full of well-connected voices, and I like being able to get a\n    lot of people’s attention when I have something to say that I think is important.</p>\n    <p>But my vibe shouldn’t be the only vibe on the menu. Some people just want to talk\n    about stuff with a few people, they don’t want to be influencers or to mainline the <i>zeitgeist</i>.</p>\n    <p>Some people are from groups endangered by online hate and violence, or experience  precarity such that they\n    just can’t afford to have every word on the permanent record. Some people are just shy.</p>\n    <p>I am a hyperoverentitled\n    thick-skinned white boy who can laugh publicly at online assholes without much concern for consequences.\n    It’s crazy to think that social media should be exclusively optimized for people like me.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-6'>There are problems</h2>\n    <p>To start with, notwithstanding all the above, I’d like more search too.  That’s not a <em>big</em> problem because I think\n    there’s a path forward that’s useful \n    and still preserves the current privacy-centric Mastodon values.</p>\n    <p>Then there’s the big problem…</p>\n    <h2 id='p-7'>Mastodon’s privacy story is terrible!</h2>\n    <p>Seriously. Unless you take special specific measures, every little snippet you post on Mastodon has a URL and anyone can\n    fetch it with a Web browser or computer program and then… well, do whatever the hell they want with it. Mastodon as it stands\n    today is not built to protect privacy.</p>\n    <p>You can get a sort of weak partial privacy if you:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Post in “Friends only” mode (which can be done per-post or as a default).</p></li>\n      <li><p>Protect your account so you get to approve or deny anyone who wants to follow you.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Get lucky, as in none of your followers republish your posts to the world or gateway them to the alt-right.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>This will <em>probably</em> keep you out of some rando’s public-search-engine experiment.</p>\n    <p>But it doesn’t matter, because the vast majority of people on Mastodon don’t understand the difference between its\n    sharing modes and probably don’t protect their account, because why should anyone have to do that?</p>\n    <p>And anyhow, we’re all…</p>\n    <h2 id='p-8'>Missing the point</h2>\n    <p>The point is, we’re not trying to solve a technical problem here, we’re trying to solve a <em>social</em> problem. We don’t\n    want people to do certain irritating and dangerous things with data scraped off the Fediverse.  So, when there are things that\n    people <em>can</em> do but shouldn’t, what tools do we usually apply?  Hmm… I guess when I said “social” I meant “legal”.</p>\n    <p>So here’s a question: When I\n    publish something, who is licensed to fetch it or, having fetched it, store it and process it, or having stored and processed\n    it, share the results with the world, or with an employer or customer?</p>\n    <p>Mastodon doesn’t help here. When you retrieve a post, you don’t have to log in to Mastodon first, so any terms and conditions\n    you might have agreed to don’t apply. You also don’t have to click through a terms-of-service pop-up.  When you follow somebody,\n    at no point (that I’ve seen anyhow) do you get notified of how\n    they’d like their posts to be treated.</p>\n    <p>So why shouldn’t you feel free to go ahead and share what you’ve received to the world or, if you’re a\n    Search weenie, write a program to follow people and index their posts?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-9'>Suggestions</h2>\n    <p>Stated in the most general possible way: <em>The Fediverse needs to get its\n    content-licensing shit together.</em></p>\n    <p>I have ideas about how this might be done, which I’m about to offer, but I Am Not A\n    Lawyer and I am especially not a copyright or intellectual-property specialist; so take these as lightweight amateur suggestions\n    designed only to start conversation.</p>\n    <p>Disclaimers in place, I propose the following. (Note that some of these proposals are not fully compatible with each\n    other.)</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>A server should deliver posts only to people logged into the instance, or to other instances it is federated\n      with.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Servers should deliver posts only after a click-through acknowledging the license covering those posts.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The Fediverse needs to work with IP lawyers, and maybe Creative Commons, to build a menu of licenses that\n      people can choose to apply to their posts.</p></li>\n      <li><p>When you follow someone, you should be forced to acknowledge their default content license, and re-acknowledge if and\n      when they change the default.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The choice of default content license for an instance is very important and needs to be communicated clearly in human\n      language not legal jargon, at the time of registration.</p>\n      <p>Many members of the current admin community would like it if the\n      default license were always highly restrictive such that you’d have to explicitly opt in to making your posts eligible for\n      mass harvesting. I can see their point, but if I’m building  an instance for people who get paid to be public, for example\n      journalists or DevRel people, I’d probably pick the opposite default.</p></li>\n      <li><p>The content-license menu should have a lot of options.  Some line up pretty well with Mastodon’s current categories:\n      “public”, “unlisted”, and “followers only”. But I can imagine finer-grained exclusions, such as allowing full-text indexing\n      but only for accounts on the same instance, or allowing use for search but no other applications. (No ML model building!)</p></li>\n      <li><p>I’m also pretty sure that content licensing should have a temporal component. That is to say “Yes, harvest this and use\n      it, but only for two weeks beginning now.”  Mastodon already has optional built-in scheduled post deletion\n      and this would have to be consistent with that.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure I’m missing important dimensions.  And I’m totally sure that creating the dialogues necessary to support\n    this constitute a UX designer’s nightmare.</p>\n    <p>Most important, I’m convinced that this is a conversation that the Fediverse leaders need to start having, and start having\n    now.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-10'>What success looks like</h2>\n    <p>I’d like it if nobody were ever deterred from conversing with people they know for fear that people they don’t\n    know will use their words to attack them. I’d like it to be legally difficult to put everyone’s everyday conversations to work\n    in service to the advertising industry.  I’d like to reduce the discomfort people in marginalized groups feel venturing forth\n    into public conversation.</p>\n    <p>But… I’d also like to search the world’s conversation to find out what’s happening right now. How are things going around Bakhmut?\n    How are people feeling about the latest shows in the Sierra Ferrell tour?\n    What’s being posted about the World Cup semifinal?\n    Are the British Tories about to knife another idiot leader?</p>\n    <p>And especially this: \n    How are they doing on fixing the winter power outage in \n    Saskatchewan, where my elderly mother lives? Not hypothetical; it happened the evening of December 27th, and\n    being able to track the status with Twitter search meant I didn’t have to organize an emergency intervention from two time-zones \n    away.</p>\n    <p>I’d also be interested in a certain amount of historic search: What exactly were world leaders saying around last February 24th?\n    How did they describe that new AWS feature at re:Invent 2017?  And so on; but only if I’m confident the people who posted what\n    I’m searching are comfortable with them being used this way.</p>\n    <p>I think we should be able to get there. But it’s not a technology problem.</p>\n</div>",

I’m as white as can be, so probably not your best source on the subject, but I felt\n    educated by Shamira Ibrahim’s\n    <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-future-of-black-twitter\">Can Black Twitter Ever <em>Really</em> Die?</a></p>\n    <p>What has happened is that a few Black people have come over, dipped their toes in the Mastodon waters, and retreated back\n    to Twitter. I have heard three very specific gripes:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Mastodon is missing some necessary affordances; in particular the Quote Tweet, said to be crucial to #BlackTwitter\n      culture.  For what it’s worth, this not a technology problem: The platform is perfectly capable of supporting QT.</p>\n      <p>So far, Mastodon’s implementers have declined to build it, based on a perception that it enables toxic performative\n      dunking.\n      Which could change.</p></li>\n      <li><p>There has been pressure on Mastodon to hide anti-racist rhetoric behind a Content Warning, as it might upset people.\n      (It’s <em>supposed</em> to upset people!) These days I see plenty of posts on the subject without either CWs or responses\n      asking for them, so \n      maybe this problem is being solved?</p></li>\n      <li><p>There are bad people in the Fediverse (*gasp*), with a substantial scattering of racists, chuds, gaslighters,\n      sealioners, TERFs, and… well, you name it. The effectiveness of the moderators varies widely from instance to instance and if\n      a person who is (for example) Black picks the wrong instance, they’re apt to find the worst kind of racist garbage thrown in\n      their face unpleasantly soon.  And even on the best instances, it’s not currently possible to keep 100% of the bad traffic\n      out. And obviously it’s not reasonable to expect newcomers to know how to find the safe spaces.</p> <p>When I found this out,\n      it didn’t surprise me.  What <em>did</em> surprise me was that moderation on Twitter had apparently gotten a lot better than\n      I’d thought.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Anyhow, given all this, there was a certain amount of anger directed at hyperprivileged people, such as for example me, at their\n    exiting Elon’s territory in pique and leaving behind those who needed that territory to exist.</p>\n    <p>The debate is fraught. Let’s listen to some Black voices: First, \n    <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/30/twitter-elon-musk-black-women-resistance/\">Why I’m not leaving\n    Twitter</a>, by Karen Attiah, from which: “Here’s the thing: In real life, Black women have not had the privilege of retreating\n    every time things get tough or our spaces get taken over by rich, obnoxious White men.” Next, \n    <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-i-quit-elon-musks-twitter\">Why I Quit Elon Musk’s\n    Twitter</a>, by Jelani Cobb: “But at least in the interim it’s worth\n    keeping in mind that some battles are simply not worth fighting, some battles must be fought, but none are worth fighting on\n    terms set by those who win by having the conflict drag on endlessly.” Last, \n    <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-social-media/\">For Black Folks, Digital Migration Is Nothing New\n    </a>, by Chris Gilliard and Kishonna Gray (who take opposing positions): “However, there is no platform without the people. It’s a\n    lesson that has been learned over and over on countless apps—if there aren’t vibrant communities willing to provide the\n    “content,” then ultimately it’s just an empty shell. So in that sense, we are all renters in a given technological\n    space.”</p>\n    <p>I will also note, without recommending,\n    <a href=\"https://techpolicy.press/the-whiteness-of-mastodon/\">The Whiteness of Mastodon</a>, which has been much-cited by others\n    discussing these issues. I read it and found little to disagree with, but it’s at least three times as long as it needs to be\n    and wordy beyond all tolerance. I think my other references say much the same thing only better.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>What, then?</h2>\n    <p>It’s… confusing. And opinions are all over the place. It’s forced me to look in the mirror, and I have, but I still can’t\n    bring myself to make my online home on Elon’s Fascism Farm.  I have not erased my account nor deleted my tweets; I do\n    post there, but only to promote my blog pieces and Mastodon. I acknowledge the first half of that is selfish. But I’m not gonna\n    crack jokes or share pictures or links or poems or juicy news. I hope this needle-threading attempt isn’t seen as betrayal of\n    communities who currently need Twitter.</p>\n    <p>But, here’s the thing: Whatever one thinks on that issue, I remain pretty sure that Twitter is heading for hard times and\n    quite likely there’ll soon come a time when no self-respecting community wants to be there.  So I think it behooves privileged\n    geeks like myself to help find and improve an alternate home for things like #BlackTwitter.</p>\n    <p>At this moment, I think Mastodon (and the technologies that enable it) represent our best bet.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Mastodon’s failings</h2>\n    <p>Oh sure, there are real ones, and they’re important. But let’s blow off bullshit first. I’ve been told multiple times about\n    <a href=\"https://www.secjuice.com/mastodon-child-porn-pedophiles/\">Mastodon: A Social Media Platform Dominated By\n    Pedophiles &amp; Child Porn</a>. Tl;dr: This article is highly misleading.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that, yeah, there is a lot of very bad stuff being served by servers using Fediverse\n    software. (Not just pedophilia, but Gab and Truth Social.)\n    But remember, the “Fedi” in that word stands for “Federation”, and any member can choose <em>not</em> to federate, and\n    it also turns out that basically every mainstream Mastodon instance knows about these problem cases and refuses to federate with\n    them. So this stuff is not, in any meaningful sense, part of the mainstream Mastodon network.</p>\n    <p>An analogy: Every second of every\n    day, there is loads of sickeningly evil stuff being exchanged between willing participants, using email. Would it be fair to say\n    that email is “dominated by” whatever flavor of filth? Of course not. Nor is mainstream Mastodon.</p>\n    <p>Um, there are subtleties here, which I don’t care to explore, but that’s OK because Ethan Zuckerman did, in\n    <a href=\"https://medium.com/@EthanZ/mastodon-is-big-in-japan-the-reason-why-is-uncomfortable-684c036498e5\">Mastodon is big in\n    Japan. The reason why is… uncomfortable</a>. Interesting, but as the title says… ewww.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Late-breaking news</h2>\n    <p>Literally as I was writing the first draft of what you’re reading, this crossed my radar:\n    <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mask-network-acquires-pawoo-net-070000858.html\">Mask Network Acquires Pawoo.net, one of\n    the largest Mastodon instances</a>. If you read Zuckerman’s piece you’ll be able to read between this one’s lines.</p>\n    <p>An\n    an organization described as “The Social Coop Limited (Social Coop), the entity affiliated with Mask Network” seems to be\n    rolling up all the stinkiest pieces of the landscape. Which may actually be helpful to those of us concerned\n    with walling them off.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>The moderation problem</h2>\n    <p>We know that there are bad people using Mastodon. Not all of them are on the fenced-off known-to-be-bad instances.  We know\n    that they are eager to harangue and doxx and SWAT and throw the X-word for every value of X. Worse than that, we know that some of\n    them are organized, ranging from incel cabals over on 8chan to sophisticated full-time employees of certain national governments\n    that simply want to tear away at our social fabric.</p>\n    <p>It seems obvious that this is the central issue for Mastodon right now.

As Twitter grows\n    troubled and troubling, “Fediverse” technologies in general and Mastodon in particular are \n    successfully attracting many users and providing a pleasant experience. Everyone is wondering out loud whether Mastodon\n    can take the strain and whether it can provide cool new features. What we haven’t been discussing are two ethical questions:\n    First, is it OK to bail out of Twitter?  And if bailing out, is Mastodon a acceptable place to land?</p>\n    <h2 id='p-1'>Bye, Twitter (OK?)</h2>\n    <p>I confess that this discussion caught me by surprise but I’m glad it did, it’s eye-opening.\n    The voices are those of Black and disabled people (mostly the former) arguing that Twitter\n    has fueled an important flowering of their culture (the hashtag is\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackTwitter&amp;src=typed_query\">#BlackTwitter</a>) and become important as a refuge,\n    a meeting place, and a source of power.  I’m as white as can be, so probably not your best source on the subject, but I felt\n    educated by Shamira Ibrahim’s\n    <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-future-of-black-twitter\">Can Black Twitter Ever <em>Really</em> Die?</a></p>\n    <p>What has happened is that a few Black people have come over, dipped their toes in the Mastodon waters, and retreated back\n    to Twitter. I have heard three very specific gripes:</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li><p>Mastodon is missing some necessary affordances; in particular the Quote Tweet, said to be crucial to #BlackTwitter\n      culture.  For what it’s worth, this not a technology problem: The platform is perfectly capable of supporting QT.</p>\n      <p>So far, Mastodon’s implementers have declined to build it, based on a perception that it enables toxic performative\n      dunking.\n      Which could change.</p></li>\n      <li><p>There has been pressure on Mastodon to hide anti-racist rhetoric behind a Content Warning, as it might upset people.\n      (It’s <em>supposed</em> to upset people!) These days I see plenty of posts on the subject without either CWs or responses\n      asking for them, so \n      maybe this problem is being solved?</p></li>\n      <li><p>There are bad people in the Fediverse (*gasp*), with a substantial scattering of racists, chuds, gaslighters,\n      sealioners, TERFs, and… well, you name it. The effectiveness of the moderators varies widely from instance to instance and if\n      a person who is (for example) Black picks the wrong instance, they’re apt to find the worst kind of racist garbage thrown in\n      their face unpleasantly soon.  And even on the best instances, it’s not currently possible to keep 100% of the bad traffic\n      out. And obviously it’s not reasonable to expect newcomers to know how to find the safe spaces.</p> <p>When I found this out,\n      it didn’t surprise me.  What <em>did</em> surprise me was that moderation on Twitter had apparently gotten a lot better than\n      I’d thought.</p></li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Anyhow, given all this, there was a certain amount of anger directed at hyperprivileged people, such as for example me, at their\n    exiting Elon’s territory in pique and leaving behind those who needed that territory to exist.</p>\n    <p>The debate is fraught. Let’s listen to some Black voices: First, \n    <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/30/twitter-elon-musk-black-women-resistance/\">Why I’m not leaving\n    Twitter</a>, by Karen Attiah, from which: “Here’s the thing: In real life, Black women have not had the privilege of retreating\n    every time things get tough or our spaces get taken over by rich, obnoxious White men.” Next, \n    <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-i-quit-elon-musks-twitter\">Why I Quit Elon Musk’s\n    Twitter</a>, by Jelani Cobb: “But at least in the interim it’s worth\n    keeping in mind that some battles are simply not worth fighting, some battles must be fought, but none are worth fighting on\n    terms set by those who win by having the conflict drag on endlessly.” Last, \n    <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-social-media/\">For Black Folks, Digital Migration Is Nothing New\n    </a>, by Chris Gilliard and Kishonna Gray (who take opposing positions): “However, there is no platform without the people. It’s a\n    lesson that has been learned over and over on countless apps—if there aren’t vibrant communities willing to provide the\n    “content,” then ultimately it’s just an empty shell. So in that sense, we are all renters in a given technological\n    space.”</p>\n    <p>I will also note, without recommending,\n    <a href=\"https://techpolicy.press/the-whiteness-of-mastodon/\">The Whiteness of Mastodon</a>, which has been much-cited by others\n    discussing these issues. I read it and found little to disagree with, but it’s at least three times as long as it needs to be\n    and wordy beyond all tolerance. I think my other references say much the same thing only better.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-2'>What, then?</h2>\n    <p>It’s… confusing. And opinions are all over the place. It’s forced me to look in the mirror, and I have, but I still can’t\n    bring myself to make my online home on Elon’s Fascism Farm.  I have not erased my account nor deleted my tweets; I do\n    post there, but only to promote my blog pieces and Mastodon. I acknowledge the first half of that is selfish. But I’m not gonna\n    crack jokes or share pictures or links or poems or juicy news. I hope this needle-threading attempt isn’t seen as betrayal of\n    communities who currently need Twitter.</p>\n    <p>But, here’s the thing: Whatever one thinks on that issue, I remain pretty sure that Twitter is heading for hard times and\n    quite likely there’ll soon come a time when no self-respecting community wants to be there.  So I think it behooves privileged\n    geeks like myself to help find and improve an alternate home for things like #BlackTwitter.</p>\n    <p>At this moment, I think Mastodon (and the technologies that enable it) represent our best bet.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-3'>Mastodon’s failings</h2>\n    <p>Oh sure, there are real ones, and they’re important. But let’s blow off bullshit first. I’ve been told multiple times about\n    <a href=\"https://www.secjuice.com/mastodon-child-porn-pedophiles/\">Mastodon: A Social Media Platform Dominated By\n    Pedophiles &amp; Child Porn</a>. Tl;dr: This article is highly misleading.</p>\n    <p>It turns out that, yeah, there is a lot of very bad stuff being served by servers using Fediverse\n    software. (Not just pedophilia, but Gab and Truth Social.)\n    But remember, the “Fedi” in that word stands for “Federation”, and any member can choose <em>not</em> to federate, and\n    it also turns out that basically every mainstream Mastodon instance knows about these problem cases and refuses to federate with\n    them. So this stuff is not, in any meaningful sense, part of the mainstream Mastodon network.</p>\n    <p>An analogy: Every second of every\n    day, there is loads of sickeningly evil stuff being exchanged between willing participants, using email. Would it be fair to say\n    that email is “dominated by” whatever flavor of filth? Of course not. Nor is mainstream Mastodon.</p>\n    <p>Um, there are subtleties here, which I don’t care to explore, but that’s OK because Ethan Zuckerman did, in\n    <a href=\"https://medium.com/@EthanZ/mastodon-is-big-in-japan-the-reason-why-is-uncomfortable-684c036498e5\">Mastodon is big in\n    Japan. The reason why is… uncomfortable</a>. Interesting, but as the title says… ewww.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-4'>Late-breaking news</h2>\n    <p>Literally as I was writing the first draft of what you’re reading, this crossed my radar:\n    <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mask-network-acquires-pawoo-net-070000858.html\">Mask Network Acquires Pawoo.net, one of\n    the largest Mastodon instances</a>. If you read Zuckerman’s piece you’ll be able to read between this one’s lines.</p>\n    <p>An\n    an organization described as “The Social Coop Limited (Social Coop), the entity affiliated with Mask Network” seems to be\n    rolling up all the stinkiest pieces of the landscape. Which may actually be helpful to those of us concerned\n    with walling them off.</p>\n    <h2 id='p-5'>The moderation problem</h2>\n    <p>We know that there are bad people using Mastodon. Not all of them are on the fenced-off known-to-be-bad instances.  We know\n    that they are eager to harangue and doxx and SWAT and throw the X-word for every value of X. Worse than that, we know that some of\n    them are organized, ranging from incel cabals over on 8chan to sophisticated full-time employees of certain national governments\n    that simply want to tear away at our social fabric.</p>\n    <p>It seems obvious that this is the central issue for Mastodon right now.  How hard is the problem, really?  For an introduction, I\n    recommend\n    <a href=\"https://escapingtech.com/tech/opinions/i-was-wrong-about-mastodon-moderation.html\">I Was Wrong About Mastodon</a>,\n    by Marcus Hutchins, which explains how the federated architecture works to support moderation.

If you only have time for one Long Link this time around, pick this.</p>\n    <p>Marc’s subject was <em>focused</em> writing, with a purpose, to explain and convince. On the other hand, \n    <a href=\"https://tom-cox.com/writing/darkening-days-in-summerland-a-personal-compendium/\">Darkening Days In Summerland: A\n    Personal Compendium</a>, by Tom Cox, is about, well, not much except how he’s feeling, and some things he did here and there\n    around the UK. But it held my attention.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreamatranga/status/1590050949128916992\">Neolithic</a> is a Twitter thread by Andrea Matranga,\n    an economist and historian, about how <i>Homo sapiens</i> moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture, starting with the\n    observation that this seems to have happened in the same brief historical period in at least seven places scattered around the\n    world. Why? (With lots of pictures.) (I know, I know, Twitter thread. Better read it while it’s still there.)</p>\n    <p>Now let’s talk about life online.\n    <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/\">The\n    Internet Is Rotting</a>, by Jonathan Zittrain, starts with the unremarkable observation that URLs are fragile (go back a decade\n    or two in this blog and try to follow some links).  What makes this interesting are his proposals for addressing the\n    problem, some of which take the form of initiatives in progress in the academic community, most of which I hadn’t known\n    about. Important stuff!</p>\n    <p>Speaking of information failure, well, uh… Twitter! In\n    <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/\">The Age of\n    Social Media Is Ending : It never should have begun</a>, Ian Bogost goes <em>very</em> deep on the nature of social media and\n    its history, and concludes, essentially, that it was doomed. Out-take:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>“It was never a <em>terrible</em> idea, at least, to use computers to connect to one another on occasion, for justified\n    reasons, and in moderation (although the risk of instrumentalizing one another was present from the outset). The problem came\n    from doing so all the time, as a lifestyle, an aspiration, an obsession. The offer was always too good to be true, but it’s\n    taken us two decades to realize the Faustian nature of the bargain. Someday, eventually, perhaps its web will unwind. But not\n    soon, and not easily.”</p></blockquote>\n    <p>I can’t be sure he’s wrong, although I retain hope that something decentralized, for example Mastodon, will arise from the\n    ashes and become a net good.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of things that are good,\n    <a href=\"https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/privacy-primer-c7b9caadfc67\">one of them is privacy</a> and thus so is encryption. And thus, so \n    is\n    <a href=\"https://signal.org\">Signal</a>. You should use it if you care about your online privacy, and you should care about your\n    online privacy. If you agree with this paragraph so far, you’ll be inspired by\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23409716/signal-encryption-messaging-sms-meredith-whittaker-imessage-whatsapp-china\">Why \n    Signal won’t compromise on encryption, with president Meredith Whittaker</a>. If you don’t agree then I strongly recommend you\n    read it anyhow. Ms Whittaker is what I call a leader.</p>\n    <p>Now, Dear Reader, I ask forgiveness as I offer a peek into an abstruse and strange corner of mathematics: A “repunit” is a\n    decimal number written only using the digit “1”. The question is, which such numbers are prime? Now, \n    before I go further, let me share a photograph from\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/08/Mileage\">11,111km on the Odometer</a>, one of the very first entries in this blog, from\n    March of 2003.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/04/Mileage.png\" alt=\"11,111km on the Odometer\" />\n    <p>This was in a little diesel VW Golf we drove at the time. When I looked at that number, I wondered if it were prime, and further, could such\n    numbers containing only 1’s could ever be prime. I poked around and concluded “I betcha there's one out there. Not in 32-bit\n    space though…”\n    This attracted the attention of at least one real mathematician, who introduced the notion of repunits. For example,\n    1,111,111,111,111,111,111, with 19 digits, is prime; a repunit prime must have a prime number of digits! The mathie said that In\n    2003, only 7 prime repunits were known.</p>\n    <p>One reason I remember this episode is because back then, some other blogger, someone important and influential, blogged\n    along the lines of “There’s this dude who posts pictures of his car dashboard, with interesting numbers, on his blog” and it got me a few\n    hundred more readers.</p>\n    <p>OK, pardon the long intro, because I just ran across\n    <a href=\"https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=602219&amp;postcount=35\">R49081 is prime!</a> where “R49081” means 49,081 1’s\n    in a row. It took 20 months of work on a pretty powerful CPU to establish this. Turns out my 2003 mathie was wrong because the author\n    says there are now <em>six</em> known repunit primes.</p>\n    <p>Another way to write this number is (10<sup>49081</sup> - 1) / 9.</p>\n    <p>OK, back to mundane reality. I’m going to close with three (written) voices who’ve contributed Long Links before.  First, Chris\n    Arnade, who goes to interesting places and walks around them and writes about it, offers\n    <a href=\"https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/walking-el-paso\">Walking El Paso</a>, from which I quote:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>When I asked him why somebody who didn’t have very much seemed so happy, he said, because “I have a roof. I have\n    food. I am safe. I see my family. I am not sure what more you need.” </p></blockquote>\n    <p>Next, from the excellent Ada Palmer’s <cite>Ex Urbe</cite> blog,\n    <a href=\"https://www.exurbe.com/educable/\">All People Are Created Educable, a Vital Oft-Forgotten Tenet of Modern\n    Democracy</a>.

If you only have time for one Long Link this time around, pick this.</p>\n    <p>Marc’s subject was <em>focused</em> writing, with a purpose, to explain and convince. On the other hand, \n    <a href=\"https://tom-cox.com/writing/darkening-days-in-summerland-a-personal-compendium/\">Darkening Days In Summerland: A\n    Personal Compendium</a>, by Tom Cox, is about, well, not much except how he’s feeling, and some things he did here and there\n    around the UK. But it held my attention.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreamatranga/status/1590050949128916992\">Neolithic</a> is a Twitter thread by Andrea Matranga,\n    an economist and historian, about how <i>Homo sapiens</i> moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture, starting with the\n    observation that this seems to have happened in the same brief historical period in at least seven places scattered around the\n    world. Why? (With lots of pictures.) (I know, I know, Twitter thread. Better read it while it’s still there.)</p>\n    <p>Now let’s talk about life online.\n    <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/\">The\n    Internet Is Rotting</a>, by Jonathan Zittrain, starts with the unremarkable observation that URLs are fragile (go back a decade\n    or two in this blog and try to follow some links).  What makes this interesting are his proposals for addressing the\n    problem, some of which take the form of initiatives in progress in the academic community, most of which I hadn’t known\n    about. Important stuff!</p>\n    <p>Speaking of information failure, well, uh… Twitter! In\n    <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/\">The Age of\n    Social Media Is Ending : It never should have begun</a>, Ian Bogost goes <em>very</em> deep on the nature of social media and\n    its history, and concludes, essentially, that it was doomed. Out-take:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>“It was never a <em>terrible</em> idea, at least, to use computers to connect to one another on occasion, for justified\n    reasons, and in moderation (although the risk of instrumentalizing one another was present from the outset). The problem came\n    from doing so all the time, as a lifestyle, an aspiration, an obsession. The offer was always too good to be true, but it’s\n    taken us two decades to realize the Faustian nature of the bargain. Someday, eventually, perhaps its web will unwind. But not\n    soon, and not easily.”</p></blockquote>\n    <p>I can’t be sure he’s wrong, although I retain hope that something decentralized, for example Mastodon, will arise from the\n    ashes and become a net good.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of things that are good,\n    <a href=\"https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/privacy-primer-c7b9caadfc67\">one of them is privacy</a> and thus so is encryption. And thus, so \n    is\n    <a href=\"https://signal.org\">Signal</a>. You should use it if you care about your online privacy, and you should care about your\n    online privacy. If you agree with this paragraph so far, you’ll be inspired by\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23409716/signal-encryption-messaging-sms-meredith-whittaker-imessage-whatsapp-china\">Why \n    Signal won’t compromise on encryption, with president Meredith Whittaker</a>. If you don’t agree then I strongly recommend you\n    read it anyhow. Ms Whittaker is what I call a leader.</p>\n    <p>Now, Dear Reader, I ask forgiveness as I offer a peek into an abstruse and strange corner of mathematics: A “repunit” is a\n    decimal number written only using the digit “1”. The question is, which such numbers are prime? Now, \n    before I go further, let me share a photograph from\n    <a href=\"/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/08/Mileage\">11,111km on the Odometer</a>, one of the very first entries in this blog, from\n    March of 2003.</p>\n    <img src=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/04/Mileage.png\" alt=\"11,111km on the Odometer\" />\n    <p>This was in a little diesel VW Golf we drove at the time. When I looked at that number, I wondered if it were prime, and further, could such\n    numbers containing only 1’s could ever be prime. I poked around and concluded “I betcha there's one out there. Not in 32-bit\n    space though…”\n    This attracted the attention of at least one real mathematician, who introduced the notion of repunits. For example,\n    1,111,111,111,111,111,111, with 19 digits, is prime; a repunit prime must have a prime number of digits! The mathie said that In\n    2003, only 7 prime repunits were known.</p>\n    <p>One reason I remember this episode is because back then, some other blogger, someone important and influential, blogged\n    along the lines of “There’s this dude who posts pictures of his car dashboard, with interesting numbers, on his blog” and it got me a few\n    hundred more readers.</p>\n    <p>OK, pardon the long intro, because I just ran across\n    <a href=\"https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=602219&amp;postcount=35\">R49081 is prime!</a> where “R49081” means 49,081 1’s\n    in a row. It took 20 months of work on a pretty powerful CPU to establish this. Turns out my 2003 mathie was wrong because the author\n    says there are now <em>six</em> known repunit primes.</p>\n    <p>Another way to write this number is (10<sup>49081</sup> - 1) / 9.</p>\n    <p>OK, back to mundane reality. I’m going to close with three (written) voices who’ve contributed Long Links before.  First, Chris\n    Arnade, who goes to interesting places and walks around them and writes about it, offers\n    <a href=\"https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/p/walking-el-paso\">Walking El Paso</a>, from which I quote:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>When I asked him why somebody who didn’t have very much seemed so happy, he said, because “I have a roof. I have\n    food. I am safe. I see my family. I am not sure what more you need.” </p></blockquote>\n    <p>Next, from the excellent Ada Palmer’s <cite>Ex Urbe</cite> blog,\n    <a href=\"https://www.exurbe.com/educable/\">All People Are Created Educable, a Vital Oft-Forgotten Tenet of Modern\n    Democracy</a>.
